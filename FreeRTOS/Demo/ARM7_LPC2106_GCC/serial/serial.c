/*
	Changes from V2.4.0

		+ Made serial ISR handling more complete and robust.

	Changes from V2.4.1

		+ Split serial.c into serial.c and serialISR.c.  serial.c can be 
		  compiled using ARM or THUMB modes.  serialISR.c must always be
		  compiled in ARM mode.
		+ Another small change to cSerialPutChar().

	Changed from V2.5.1

		+ In cSerialPutChar() an extra check is made to ensure the post to
		  the queue was successful if then attempting to retrieve the posted
		  character.
