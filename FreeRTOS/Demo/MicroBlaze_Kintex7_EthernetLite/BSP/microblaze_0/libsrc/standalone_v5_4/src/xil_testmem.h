 * @file xil_testmem.h
 *
 * This file contains utility functions to test memory.
 *
 * <b>Memory test description</b>
 *
 * A subset of the memory tests can be selected or all of the tests can be run
 * in order. If there is an error detected by a subtest, the test stops and the
 * failure code is returned. Further tests are not run even if all of the tests
 * are selected.
 *
 * Subtest descriptions:
 * <pre>
 * XIL_TESTMEM_ALLMEMTESTS:
 *       Runs all of the following tests
 *
 * XIL_TESTMEM_INCREMENT:
 *       Incrementing Value Test.
 *       This test starts at 'XIL_TESTMEM_INIT_VALUE' and uses the
 *	incrementing value as the test value for memory.
 *
 * XIL_TESTMEM_WALKONES:
 *       Walking Ones Test.
 *       This test uses a walking '1' as the test value for memory.
 *       location 1 = 0x00000001
 *       location 2 = 0x00000002
 *       ...
 *
 * XIL_TESTMEM_WALKZEROS:
 *       Walking Zero's Test.
 *       This test uses the inverse value of the walking ones test
 *       as the test value for memory.
 *       location 1 = 0xFFFFFFFE
 *       location 2 = 0xFFFFFFFD
 *       ...
 *
 * XIL_TESTMEM_INVERSEADDR:
 *       Inverse Address Test.
 *       This test uses the inverse of the address of the location under test
 *       as the test value for memory.
 *
 * XIL_TESTMEM_FIXEDPATTERN:
 *       Fixed Pattern Test.
 *       This test uses the provided patters as the test value for memory.
 *       If zero is provided as the pattern the test uses '0xDEADBEEF".
 * </pre>
 *
 * <i>WARNING</i>
 *
 * The tests are <b>DESTRUCTIVE</b>. Run before any initialized memory spaces
 * have been set up.
 *
 * The address provided to the memory tests is not checked for
 * validity except for the NULL case. It is possible to provide a code-space
 * pointer for this test to start with and ultimately destroy executable code
 * causing random failures.
 *
 * @note
 *
 * Used for spaces where the address range of the region is smaller than
 * the data width. If the memory range is greater than 2 ** width,
 * the patterns used in XIL_TESTMEM_WALKONES and XIL_TESTMEM_WALKZEROS will
 * repeat on a boundry of a power of two making it more difficult to detect
 * addressing errors. The XIL_TESTMEM_INCREMENT and XIL_TESTMEM_INVERSEADDR
 * tests suffer the same problem. Ideally, if large blocks of memory are to be
 * tested, break them up into smaller regions of memory to allow the test
 * patterns used not to repeat over the region tested.
 *
 * <pre>
 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver    Who    Date    Changes

 * 1.00a hbm  08/25/09 First release
