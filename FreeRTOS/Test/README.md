## Testing in FreeRTOS
FreeRTOS kernel consists of common code and porting layer. Extensive [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) and [dynamic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis) are done on both to ensure functional correctness of FreeRTOS kernel.

## Directory structure
This directory is in working progress -- we are migrating scattered test cases to this directory. Here only lists what's currently under this directory.

- ```./CBMC```: This directory contains automated proofs of the memory safety of various parts of the FreeRTOS code base.
- ```./VeriFast```: This directory contains automated proofs of the functional correctness of various parts of the FreeRTOS code base.
