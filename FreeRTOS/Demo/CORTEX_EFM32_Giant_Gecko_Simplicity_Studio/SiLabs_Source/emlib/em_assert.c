 * @brief
 *   EFM internal assert handling.
 *
 *   This function is invoked through EFM_ASSERT() macro usage only, it should
 *   not be used explicitly.
 *
 *   Currently this implementation only enters an indefinite loop, allowing
 *   the use of a debugger to determine cause of failure. By defining
 *   DEBUG_EFM_USER to the preprocessor for all files, a user defined version
 *   of this function must be defined and will be invoked instead, possibly
 *   providing output of assertion location.
 *
 *   Please notice that this function is not used unless DEBUG_EFM is defined
 *   during preprocessing of EFM_ASSERT() usage.
 *
 * @par file
 *   Name of source file where assertion failed.
 *
 * @par line
 *   Line number in source file where assertion failed.
