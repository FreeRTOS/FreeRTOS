 *  @file       PWMTimerCC32XX.h
 *
 *  @brief      PWM driver implementation using CC32XX General Purpose Timers.
 *
 *  The PWM header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/PWM.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/pwm/PWMTimerCC32XX.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref PWM.h for a complete description of the PWM
 *  driver APIs provided and examples of their use.
 *
 *  ## Overview #
 *  This driver configures a CC32XX General Purpose Timer (GPT) in PWM mode.
 *  When in PWM mode, each GPT is divided into 2 PWM outputs.  This driver
 *  manages each output as an independent PWM instance.  The timer is
 *  automatically configured in count-down mode using the system clock as
 *  the source.
 *
 *  The timers operate at the system clock frequency (80 MHz). So each timer
 *  tick is 12.5 ns. The period and duty registers are 16 bits wide; thus
 *  8-bit prescalars are used to extend period and duty registers.  The
 *  maximum value supported is 16777215 timer counts ((2^24) - 1) or
 *  209715 microseconds.  Updates to a PWM's period or duty will occur
 *  instantaneously (GPT peripherals do not have shadow registers).
 *
 *  Finally, when this driver is opened, it automatically changes the
 *  PWM pin's parking configuration (used when entering low power modes) to
 *  correspond with the PWM_IDLE_LEVEL set in the PWM_params.  However, this
 *  setting is not reverted once the driver is closed, it is the users
 *  responsibility to change the parking configuration if necessary.
 *
 *  ### CC32xx PWM Driver Configuration #
 *
 *  In order to use the PWM APIs, the application is required
 *  to define 4 configuration items in the application Board.c file:
 *
 *  1.  An array of PWMTimerCC32XX_Object elements, which will be used by
 *  by the driver to maintain instance state.
 *  Below is an example PWMTimerCC32XX_Object array appropriate for the CC3220SF Launchpad
 *  board:
 *  @code
 *    #include <ti/drivers/PWM.h>
 *    #include <ti/drivers/pwm/PWMTimerCC32XX.h>
 *
 *    PWMTimerCC32XX_Object pwmTimerCC3220SObjects[CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_PWMCOUNT];
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  2.  An array of PWMTimerCC32XX_HWAttrsV2 elements that defines which
 *  pin will be used by the corresponding PWM instance
 *  (see @ref pwmPinIdentifiersCC32XX).
 *  Below is an example PWMTimerCC32XX_HWAttrsV2 array appropriate for the CC3220SF Launchpad
 *  board:
 *  @code
 *    const PWMTimerCC32XX_HWAttrsV2 pwmTimerCC3220SHWAttrs[CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_PWMCOUNT] = {
 *        {
 *            .pwmPin = PWMTimerCC32XX_PIN_01
 *        },
 *        {
 *            .pwmPin = PWMTimerCC32XX_PIN_02
 *        }
 *    };
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  3.  An array of @ref PWM_Config elements, one for each PWM instance. Each
 *  element of this array identifies the device-specific API function table,
 *  the device specific PWM object instance, and the device specific Hardware
 *  Attributes to be used for each PWM channel.
 *  Below is an example @ref PWM_Config array appropriate for the CC3220SF Launchpad
 *  board:
 *  @code
 *    const PWM_Config PWM_config[CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_PWMCOUNT] = {
 *        {
 *            .fxnTablePtr = &PWMTimerCC32XX_fxnTable,
 *            .object = &pwmTimerCC3220SObjects[CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_PWM6],
 *            .hwAttrs = &pwmTimerCC3220SHWAttrs[CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_PWM6]
 *        },
 *        {
 *            .fxnTablePtr = &PWMTimerCC32XX_fxnTable,
 *            .object = &pwmTimerCC3220SObjects[CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_PWM7],
 *            .hwAttrs = &pwmTimerCC3220SHWAttrs[CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_PWM7]
 *        }
 *    };
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  4.  A global variable, PWM_count, that informs the driver how many PWM
 *  instances are defined:
 *  @code
 *    const uint_least8_t PWM_count = CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_PWMCOUNT;
 *  @endcode
 *
 * ### Power Management #
 * The TI-RTOS power management framework will try to put the device into the most
 * power efficient mode whenever possible. Please see the technical reference
 * manual for further details on each power mode.
 *
 *  The PWMTimerCC32XX driver explicitly sets a power constraint when the
 *  PWM is running to prevent LPDS and SHUTDOWN Power modes.
 *  The following statements are valid:
 *    - After PWM_open():  Clocks are enabled to the timer resource and the
 *                         configured pwmPin. The device is still allowed
 *                         to enter LPDS and SHUTDOWN.
 *    - After PWM_start(): LPDS and SHUTDOWN modes are disabled. The device
 *                         can only go to Idle power mode since the
 *                         high-frequency clock is needed for PWM operation:
 *    - After PWM_stop():  Conditions are equal as for after PWM_open
 *    - After PWM_close(): The underlying GPTimer is turned off, and the clocks
 *                         to the timer and pin are disabled..
