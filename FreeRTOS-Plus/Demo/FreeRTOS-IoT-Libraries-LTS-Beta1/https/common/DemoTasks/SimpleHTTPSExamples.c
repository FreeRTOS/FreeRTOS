/*
 * This file contains the common functions for plain text, basic TLS, and mutual
 * authentication HTTPS demos. Aside from the difference in security level during
 * connect, the three demos perform the same interaction with a HTTPS host. The
 * demo creates a singe application task that loops through a set of examples
 * demonstrating how to the connect to the server, send a few types of requests to
 * the server (GET, HEAD, PUT, POST), and disconnect from the server again. All
 * of the responses and their associated HTTPS response status codes are printed
 * to the console.
 *
 * The plain text HTTP demo does not authenticate the server nor the client. The
 * basic TLS HTTPS demo builds on top of the plain text demo, adding broker
 * authentication and encryption. The mutual authentication HTTPS demo builds on
 * top of the basic TLS demo, enabling both server and client authentication.
 *
 * For more information regarding the HTTPS library and the demo, please refer to:
 * https://www.freertos.org/https/index.html
