If you need the demo that used to be in this directory then download FreeRTOS V8.2.3
from http://sourceforge.net/projects/freertos/files/FreeRTOS/ - however it is
recommended that the Win32 demo is used instead.  See
http://www.freertos.org/simple-freertos-demos.html for links to the Win32 demo.
