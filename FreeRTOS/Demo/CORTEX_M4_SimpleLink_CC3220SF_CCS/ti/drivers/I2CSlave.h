/** ============================================================================
 *  @file       I2CSlave.h
 *
 *  @brief      I2CSlave driver interface
 *
 *  The I2CSlave header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/I2CSlave.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *  The I2CSlave driver operates as a slave on an I2C bus in either
 *  I2CSLAVE_MODE_BLOCKING or I2CSLAVE_MODE_CALLBACK.
 *  In blocking mode, the task's execution is blocked during the I2CSlave
 *  read/write transfer. When the transfer has completed, code execution will
 *  resume. In callback mode, the task's execution is not blocked, allowing
 *  for other transactions to be queued up or to process some other code. When
 *  the transfer has completed, the I2CSlave driver will call a user-specified
 *  callback function (from a HWI context).
 *
 *  The APIs in this driver serve as an interface to a typical TI-RTOS
 *  application. The specific peripheral implementations are responsible to
 *  create all the SYS/BIOS specific primitives to allow for thread-safe
 *  operation.
 *
 *  ## Opening the driver #
 *
 *  @code
 *  I2CSlave_Handle      handle;
 *  I2CSlave_Params      params;
 *
 *  I2CSlave_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.transferMode  = I2CSLAVE_MODE_CALLBACK;
 *  params.transferCallbackFxn = someI2CSlaveCallbackFunction;
 *  handle = I2CSlave_open(someI2CSlave_configIndexValue, &params);
 *  if (!handle) {
 *      System_printf("I2CSlave did not open");
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## Transferring data #
 *  A I2CSlave transaction with a I2CSlave peripheral is started by calling
 *  I2CSlave_read() or I2CSlave_write().
 *  Each transfer is performed atomically with the I2CSlave peripheral.
 *
 *  @code
 *  ret = I2CSlave_read(i2cSlave, buffer, 5)
 *  if (!ret) {
 *      System_printf("Unsuccessful I2CSlave read");
 *  }
 *
 *  I2CSlave_write(i2cSlave, buffer, 3);
 *  if (!ret) {
 *      System_printf("Unsuccessful I2CSlave write");
 *  }
 *
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  This module serves as the main interface for TI-RTOS
 *  applications. Its purpose is to redirect the module's APIs to specific
 *  peripheral implementations which are specified using a pointer to a
 *  I2CSlave_FxnTable.
 *
 *  The I2CSlave driver interface module is joined (at link time) to a
 *  NULL-terminated array of I2CSlave_Config data structures named
 *  *I2CSlave_config*. *I2CSlave_config* is implemented in the application
 *  with each entry being an instance of a I2CSlave peripheral. Each entry in
 *  *I2CSlave_config* contains a:
 *  - (I2CSlave_FxnTable *) to a set of functions that implement an I2CSlave
 *  - (void *) data object that is associated with the I2CSlave_FxnTable
 *  - (void *) hardware attributes that are associated to the I2CSlave_FxnTable
 *
 *  # Instrumentation #
 *  The I2CSlave driver interface produces log statements if instrumentation is
 *  enabled.
 *
 *  Diagnostics Mask | Log details |
