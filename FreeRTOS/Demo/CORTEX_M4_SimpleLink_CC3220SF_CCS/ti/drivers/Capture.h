 *
 *  @brief      Capture driver interface
 *
 *  The Capture header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/Capture.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *  The Capture driver facilitates the capture routines by using general purpose
 *  timers. Capture instances must be opened by calling Capture_open() while
 *  passing in a Capture index and parameters data structure.
 *
 *  When a capture instance is opened, the capture triggering edge and callback
 *  function are configured. The capture is stopped after calling Capture_open()
 *  until Capture_start() is called.
 *
 *  When Capture_open() is called, it tries to occupy the user-specified timer by
 *  calling Timer_open(). If that timer is already allocated for other modules,
 *  NULL is returned. Otherwise, the Capture_Handle is returned.
 *
 *  A capture is triggered based on the user-specified capture mode:
 *      - CAPTURE_MODE_RISING_RISING
 *      - CAPTURE_MODE_RISING_FALLING
 *      - CAPTURE_MODE_ANY_EDGE
 *  The user-specified callback function is called once the input signal matches
 *  the capture mode and the value passed into callback function is the interval
 *  between two triggering edge in the user-specified unit.
 *
 *  ## opening the driver ##
 *
 *  @code
 *  Capture_Handle      handle;
 *  Capture_Params      params;
 *
 *  Capture_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.mode  = CAPTURE_MODE_RISING_FALLING;
 *  params.callbackFxn = someCaptureCallbackFunction;
 *  params.periodUnit = CAPTURE_PERIOD_US;
 *  handle = Capture_open(someCapture_configIndexValue, &params);
 *  if (!handle)
 *  {
 *      System_printf("Capture did not open");
 *  }
 *
 *  ## starting the driver ##
 *
 *  @code
 *  status = Capture_start(handle);
 *  if (status == Capture_STATUS_ERROR)
 *  {
 *      System_printf("Capture cannot start");
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## stoping the driver ##
 *
 *  @code
 *  Capture_stop(handle);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## closing the driver ##
 *
 *  @code
 *  Capture_close(handle);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  This module serves as the main interface for TI-RTOS
 *  applications. Its purpose is to redirect the module's APIs to specific
 *  peripheral implementations which are specified using a pointer to a
 *  Capture_FxnTable.
 *
 *  The Capture driver interface module is joined (at link time) to a
 *  NULL-terminated array of Capture_Config data structures named *Capture_Config*.
 *  *Capture_Config* is implemented in the application with each entry being an
 *  instance of a Capture module. Each entry in *Capture_Config* contains a:
 *  - (Capture_FxnTable *) to a set of functions that implement a Capture module
 *  - (void *) data object that is associated with the Capture_FxnTable
 *  - (void *) hardware attributes that are associated to the Capture_FxnTable
 *
 *  # Instrumentation #
 *  The Capture driver interface produces log statements if instrumentation is
 *  enabled.
 *
 *  Diagnostics Mask | Log details |
 *  ---------------- | ----------- |
 *  Diags_USER1      | basic operations performed |
 *  Diags_USER2      | detailed operations performed |
