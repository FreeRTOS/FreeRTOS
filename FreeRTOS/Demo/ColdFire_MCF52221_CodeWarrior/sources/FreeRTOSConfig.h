/* CodeWarrior often thinks it knows better than you which files you want to 
build - and changes the port.c and portasm.S files included in the project from
the ColdFire V1 versions to the x86 versions.  If you get lots of errors output
when either file is compiled then delete the files from the project and then
add back in the port.c and portasm.S files that are located in the 
FreeRTOS\Source\portable\GCC\ColdFire_V2 directory.  Remove the line below
before compiling. */
