 * @file usleep.c
 *
 * This function supports user configurable sleep implementation.
 * This provides a microsecond delay using the timer specified by the user in
 * the ARM Cortex R5 MP core.
 *
 * <pre>
 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who      Date     Changes
 * ----- -------- -------- -----------------------------------------------
 * 5.00     pkp      02/20/14 First release
 * 5.04  pkp		 02/19/16 usleep routine is modified to use TTC3 if present
 *						  else it will use set of assembly instructions to
 *						  provide the required delay
 * 5.04	pkp		 03/09/16 Assembly routine for usleep is modified to avoid
 *						  disabling the interrupt
 * 5.04	pkp		 03/11/16 Compare the counter value to previously read value
 *						  to detect the overflow for TTC3
 * 6.0   asa      08/15/16 Updated the usleep signature. Fix for CR#956899.
 * 6.6	srm      10/18/17 Updated sleep routines to support user configurable
 *			  implementation. Now sleep routines will use TTC
 *                         instance specified by user.

 *
 * @note		By default, usleep is implemented using TTC3. Although user is
 *               given an option to select other instances of TTC. When the user
 *               selects other instances of TTC, usleep is implemented by that
 *		specific TTC instance. If the user didn't select any other instance
 *		of TTC specifically and when TTC3 is absent, usleep is implemented
 *                  using assembly instructions which is tested with instruction and
 *		data caches enabled and it gives proper delay. It may give more
 *		delay than exepcted when caches are disabled. If interrupt comes
 *		when usleep using assembly instruction is being executed, the delay
 *		may be greater than what is expected since once the interrupt is
 *		served count resumes from where it was interrupted unlike the case
 *		of TTC3 where counter keeps running while interrupt is being served.
