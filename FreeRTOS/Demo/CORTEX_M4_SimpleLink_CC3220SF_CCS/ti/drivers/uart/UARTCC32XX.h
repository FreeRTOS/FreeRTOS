 *  @file       UARTCC32XX.h
 *
 *  @brief      UART driver implementation for a CC32XX UART controller
 *
 *  The UART header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/UART.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/uart/UARTCC32XX.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref UART.h for a complete description of APIs & example of use.
 *
 *  # Stack requirements #
 *  The UARTCC32XX driver is (ring) buffered driver, and stores data it may
 *  have already received in a user-supplied background buffer.
 *  @sa ::UARTCC32XX_HWAttrsV1
 *
 *  While permitted, it is STRONGLY suggested to avoid implementations where
 *  you call UART_read() within its own callback function (when in
 *  UART_MODE_CALLBACK).  Doing so, will require additional (task and system)
 *  stack for each nested UART_read() call.
 *
 *  Tool chain | Number of bytes per nested UART_read() call
 *  ---------- | ------------------------------------------------
 *  GNU        |  96 bytes + callback function stack requirements
 *  IAR        |  40 bytes + callback function stack requirements
 *  TI         |  80 bytes + callback function stack requirements
 *
 *  It is important to note a potential worst case scenario:
 *      A full ring buffer with data; say 32 bytes
 *      The callback function calls UART_read() with a size of 1 (byte)
 *      No other variables are allocated in the callback function
 *      No other function calls are made in the callback function
 *
 *  As a result, you need an additional task and system stack of:
 *  32 bytes  * (80 bytes for TI + 0 bytes by the callback function) = 2.5kB
 *
 *  # Device Specific Pin Mode Macros #
 *  This header file contains pin mode definitions used to specify the
 *  UART TX and RX pin assignment in the UARTCC32XX_HWAttrsV1 structure.
 *  Please refer to the CC32XX Techincal Reference Manual for details on pin
 *  multiplexing.  The bits in the pin mode macros are as follows:
 *  The lower 8 bits of the macro refer to the pin, offset by 1, to match
 *  driverlib pin defines.  For example, UARTCC32XX_PIN_01_UART1_TX & 0xff = 0,
 *  which equals PIN_01 in driverlib pin.h.  By matching the PIN_xx defines in
 *  driverlib pin.h, we can pass the pin directly to the driverlib functions.
 *  The upper 8 bits of the macro correspond to the pin mux confg mode
 *  value for the pin to operate in the UART mode.  For example, pin 1 is
 *  configured with mode 7 to operate as UART1 TX.

 *  @brief      UARTCC32XX Hardware attributes
 *
 *  The fields, baseAddr, intNum, and flowControl, are used by driverlib
 *  APIs and therefore must be populated by
 *  driverlib macro definitions. For CC32XXWare these definitions are found in:
 *      - inc/hw_memmap.h
 *      - inc/hw_ints.h
 *      - driverlib/uart.h
 *
 *  intPriority is the UART peripheral's interrupt priority, as defined by the
 *  underlying OS.  It is passed unmodified to the underlying OS's interrupt
 *  handler creation code, so you need to refer to the OS documentation
 *  for usage.  For example, for SYS/BIOS applications, refer to the
 *  ti.sysbios.family.arm.m3.Hwi documentation for SYS/BIOS usage of
 *  interrupt priorities.  If the driver uses the ti.dpl interface
 *  instead of making OS calls directly, then the HwiP port handles the
 *  interrupt priority in an OS specific way.  In the case of the SYS/BIOS
 *  port, intPriority is passed unmodified to Hwi_create().
 *
 *  A sample structure is shown below:
 *  @code
 *  unsigned char uartCC32XXRingBuffer[2][32];
 *
 *  const UARTCC32XX_HWAttrsV1 uartCC32XXHWAttrs[] = {
 *      {
 *          .baseAddr = UARTA0_BASE,
 *          .intNum = INT_UARTA0,
 *          .intPriority = (~0),

 *          .ringBufPtr  = uartCC32XXRingBuffer[0],
