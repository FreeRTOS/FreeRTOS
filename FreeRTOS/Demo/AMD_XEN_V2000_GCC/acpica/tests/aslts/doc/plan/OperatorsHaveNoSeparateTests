==============================


   Below are enumerated all the ASL operators
   (32) which for now have no separate tests.



   1. Intensively applied in other tests and thus
      might be considered being already verified.

      Do simple separate test for each of these
      operators which will be the places where,
      in the future, the additional sub-tests for
      these operators, if any, could be located.

ArgX
LocalX
Name
Buffer
String
Store
CopyObject

   2. Indirectly verified

Include

   3. There is no usual way to verify them.

      The tests might be either omitted or could be done
      basing on the extension of the "memory consumption
      instrumentation" supplying the ASL tests with the
      required internal information.

Fatal
Notify

   4. Can't be verified in our test suite

Load
Unload
External
LoadTable
BreakPoint
DefinitionBlock  (each test is represented as this kind block)
DataTableRegion

   5. It is not worthy of to be definitely verified.

      Do simplest test, check only that execution
      of this operator doesn't produce exception.

      17.5.83 NoOp Description: This operation has no effect.

      To verify the sentence like the above definitely is too
      complicated thing - if you have proved it for N conditions
      it nevertheless can fail in (N+1)-th condition. The relevant
      test should involve all the possible functionality of the
      interpreter inserting everywhere this NoOp and verifying
      everything each time.
      Apparently, it is not worth the trouble.
      It is a simple operator and it can be and should be
      implemented with the care once.

   6. Can in principle be ever in the future verified
      (applying auxiliary script)

      (see e-mail RE:Planning ACPICA validation 19.11.2004,
       303_test_for_debug attachment for more details)

   7. Do the simple test, but not comprehensive

      The comprehensive verification of this operator
      could be conceived based on the following principle
      - do replacement of all (or most of them, or at least
      globally declared of them) the objects applied in the
      test suite by the Aliases to them. This could be done
      basing on the conditional #if ASL compilation which is
      not provided now by iASL, and require the separate
      compilation and run of the test suite.

      Such the comprehensive test would actually show that
      "AliasObject acts exactly the same as SourceObject"
      (as far as the test suite actually provides coverage).

      But we have at least one reason for the simple test,
      but not comprehensive - there is no #if ASL ability,
      and the second issue is either the verification of
      this operator is worthy of the considerable and full
      of work restructurization of the test suite.

      We propose to do the simple test which use only
      ObjectType (and SizeOf) for verification of each
      type of SourceObject. One more checking will be
      the overwritings with the different type object:

          CopyObject(XXX, AliasObject)  --> check SourceObject
          CopyObject(XXX, SourceObject) --> check AliasObject

      This operator doesn't add functionality, it is only for
      convenience (but since provided it should be verified).
