 *
 *  @brief      Camera driver interface
 *
 *  The Camera header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/Camera.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Overview #
 *  The Camera driver is used to retrieve the data being transferred by the
 *  Camera sensor.
 *  This driver provides an API for capturing the image from the Camera sensor.
 *  The camera sensor control and implementation are the responsibility of the
 *  application using the interface.
 *
 *  The Camera driver has been designed to operate in an RTOS environment.  It
 *  protects its transactions with OS primitives supplied by the underlying
 *  RTOS.
 *
 *  # Usage #
 *
 *  The Camera driver includes the following APIs:
 *    - Camera_init(): Initialize the Camera driver.
 *    - Camera_Params_init():  Initialize a #Camera_Params structure with default
 *      vaules.
 *    - Camera_open():  Open an instance of the Camera driver.
 *    - Camera_control():  Performs implemenation-specific features on a given
 *      Camera peripheral.
 *    - Camera_capture():  Capture a frame.
 *    - Camera_close():  De-initialize a given Camera instance.
 *
 *
 *  ### Camera Driver Configuration #
 *
 *  In order to use the Camera APIs, the application is required
 *  to provide device-specific Camera configuration in the Board.c file.
 *  The Camera driver interface defines a configuration data structure:
 *
 *  @code
 *  typedef struct Camera_Config_ {
 *      Camera_FxnTable const  *fxnTablePtr;
 *      void                   *object;
 *      void            const  *hwAttrs;
 *  } Camera_Config;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The application must declare an array of Camera_Config elements, named
 *  Camera_config[].  Each element of Camera_config[] must be populated with
 *  pointers to a device specific Camera driver implementation's function
 *  table, driver object, and hardware attributes.  The hardware attributes
 *  define properties such as the Camera peripheral's base address.
 *  Each element in Camera_config[] corresponds to
 *  a Camera instance, and none of the elements should have NULL pointers.
 *  There is no correlation between the index and the
 *  peripheral designation (such as Camera0 or Camera1).  For example, it
 *  is possible to use Camera_config[0] for Camera1.
 *
 *  Because the Camera configuration is very device dependent, you will need to
 *  check the doxygen for the device specific Camera implementation.  There you
 *  will find a description of the Camera hardware attributes.  Please also
 *  refer to the Board.c file of any of your examples to see the Camera
 *  configuration.
 *
 *  ### Initializing the Camear Driver #
 *  The application initializes the Camera driver by calling Camera_init().
 *  This function must be called before any other Camera API.  Camera_init()
 *  iterates through the elements of the Camera_config[] array, calling
 *  the element's device implementation Camera initialization function.
 *  ### Camera Parameters
 *
 *  The #Camera_Params structure is passed to Camera_open().  If NULL
 *  is passed for the parameters, Camera_open() uses default parameters.
 *  A #Camera_Params structure is initialized with default values by passing
 *  it to Camera_Params_init().
 *  Some of the Camera parameters are described below.  To see brief descriptions
 *  of all the parameters, see #Camera_Params.
 *
 *  #### Camera Modes
 *  The Camera driver operates in either blocking mode or callback mode:
 *  - #Camera_MODE_BLOCKING: The call to Camera_capture() blocks until the
 *    capture has completed.
 *  - #Camera_MODE_CALLBACK: The call to Camera_capture() returns immediately.
 *    When the capture completes, the Camera driver will call a user-
 *    specified callback function.
 *
 *  The capture mode is determined by the #Camera_Params.captureMode parameter
 *  passed to Camera_open().  The Camera driver defaults to blocking mode, if the
 *  application does not set it.
 *
 *  Once a Camera driver instance is opened, the only way
 *  to change the capture mode is to close and re-open the Camera
 *  instance with the new capture mode.
 *
 *  ### Opening the driver #
 *  The following example opens a Camera driver instance in blocking mode:
 *  @code
 *  Camera_Handle      handle;
 *  Camera_Params      params;
 *
 *  Camera_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.captureMode       =  Camera_MODE_BLOCKING;
 *  < Change any other params as required >
 *
 *  handle = Camera_open(someCamera_configIndexValue, &params);
 *  if (!handle) {
 *      // Error opening the Camera driver
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ### Capturing an Image #
 *
 *  The following code example captures a frame.
 *
 *  @code
 *  unsigned char captureBuffer[1920];
 *
 *  ret = Camera_capture(handle, &captureBuffer, sizeof(captureBuffer));
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  This module serves as the main interface for RTOS
 *  applications. Its purpose is to redirect the module's APIs to specific
 *  peripheral implementations which are specified using a pointer to a
 *  #Camera_FxnTable.
 *
 *  The Camera driver interface module is joined (at link time) to an
 *  array of #Camera_Config data structures named *Camera_config*.
 *  *Camera_config* is implemented in the application with each entry being an
 *  instance of a Camera peripheral. Each entry in *Camera_config* contains a:
 *  - (Camera_FxnTable *) to a set of functions that implement a Camera
 *     peripheral
 *  - (void *) data object that is associated with the Camera_FxnTable
 *  - (void *) hardware attributes that are associated to the Camera_FxnTable
