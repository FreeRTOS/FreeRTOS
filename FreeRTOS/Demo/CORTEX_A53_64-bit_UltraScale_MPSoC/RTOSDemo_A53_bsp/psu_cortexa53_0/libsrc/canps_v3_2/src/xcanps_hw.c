/**
 *
 * This function resets the CAN device. Calling this function resets the device
 * immediately, and any pending transmission or reception is terminated at once.
 * Both Object Layer and Transfer Layer are reset. This function does not reset
 * the Physical Layer. All registers are reset to the default values, and no
 * previous status will be restored. TX FIFO, RX FIFO and TX High Priority
 * Buffer are also reset.
 *
 * The CAN device will be in Configuration Mode immediately after this function
 * returns.
 *
 * @param	BaseAddr is the baseaddress of the interface.
 *
 * @return	None.

 * @note		None.
