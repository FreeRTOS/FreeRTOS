/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting (defined in this file) is used to
 * select between the two.  The simply blinky demo is implemented and described
 * in main_blinky.c.  The more comprehensive test and demo application is
 * implemented and described in main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.  It also contains a dummy
 * interrupt service routine called Dummy_IRQHandler() that is provided as an
 * example of how to use interrupt safe FreeRTOS API functions (those that end
 * in "FromISR").
