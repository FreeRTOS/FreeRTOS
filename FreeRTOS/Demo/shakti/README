steps run demo applications
===========================

1. git clone https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS.git --recurse-submodules

2. Please ensure, you installed the risc-v toolchain and exported them to 'PATH' variable. 
   Please refer documentation section in https://shakti.org.in/sp2020-shakti.html for more details.
   https://shakti.org.in/docs/shakti-soc-user-manual.pdf has the steps to setup the board, install tool-chain and write applications.

Demo for vajra SoC
==================
Read the temperature and pressure from the surrounding environment. Store the value in internal SPI flash.
Based on the temperature, decide to control Fan and Air conditioner.

GPIO0 - Control to AC
GPIO7 - Control to Full Fan rotation.
GPIO8 - Control to Half Speed Fan rotation.
 
Connections of the BMP280 sensor:

    VCC to 3.3V
    GND to GND
    SCL to SCL of board
    SDA to SDA of board
    CSB to 3.3V
    SDO to GND

Refer pin map in the [document]{https://shakti.org.in/docs/shakti-soc-user-manual.pdf}
 
cd FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/Demo/shakti/vajra
make

Demo for parashu SoC
====================

Application same as above

cd FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/Demo/shakti/parashu
make

Demo for pinaka SoC
===================

Read the value from GPIO0 port. Based on this value control the led connected to GPIO1.

Refer pin map in the [document]{https://shakti.org.in/docs/shakti-soc-user-manual.pdf}

cd FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/Demo/shakti/pinaka
