0. Building on *nix from git repository

    Run the autogen script to generate configure, then proceed to step 1.
    Prerequisites: You'll need autoconf, automake and libtool installed.

    $ ./autogen.sh

1. Building on *nix from a release

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check   # (optional, but highly recommended)
    $ sudo make install

2. Building on iOS

    Use on the xcode project in IDE/iOS/wolfssl.xcodeproj
    There is a README in IDE/iOS with more information

3. Building on Windows

    Use the 32bit Visual Studio Solution wolfssl.sln
    For a 64bit solution please use wolfssl64.sln

4. Building with IAR

    Please see the README in IDE/IAR-EWARM for detailed instructions

5. Building with Keil

    Please see the Keil Projects in IDE/MDK5-ARM/Projects

6. Building with Microchip tools

    Please see the README in mplabx

7. Building with Freescale MQX

    Please see the README in mqx

8. Building with Rowley CrossWorks for ARM

    Use the CrossWorks project in IDE/ROWLEY-CROSSWORKS-ARM/wolfssl.hzp
    There is a README.md in IDE/ROWLEY-CROSSWORKS-ARM with more information

9. Building with Arduino

    Use the script IDE/ARDUINO/wolfssl-arduino.sh to reformat the wolfSSL
    library for compatibility with the Arduino IDE. There is a README.md in
    IDE/ARDUINO for detailed instructions.

10. Building for Android with Visual Studio 2017

    Please see the README in IDE/VS-ARM.
    Use the Visual Studio solution IDE/VS-ARM/wolfssl.sln.

11. Building for Yocto Project or OpenEmbedded

    Please see the README in the "meta-wolfssl" repository. This repository
    holds wolfSSL's Yocto and OpenEmbedded layer, which contains recipes
    for wolfSSL, wolfSSH, wolfMQTT, wolfTPM, wolfCrypt examples, and OSS
    project bbappend files.

    https://github.com/wolfssl/meta-wolfssl

    The wolfSSL recipe can also be found in the OpenEmbedded
    "meta-openembedded/meta-networking/recipes-connectivity" layer:

    https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded

12. Porting to a new platform

    Please see section 2.4 in the manual:
    http://www.wolfssl.com/yaSSL/Docs-cyassl-manual-2-building-cyassl.html

13. Building with CMake
    Note: Primary development uses automake (./configure). The support for CMake is minimal.

    Internally cmake is setup to do the following:
    1. Uses the ./configure generated wolfssl/options.h as the build options by coping it to the build directory as user_settings.h.
    2. Builds wolfSSL as library.
    3. Builds the examples.

    Build Steps:
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ cmake --build .
    $ cmake --install .

    To build library only and not build examples and test apps use:
    $ cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=NO

    To build with debugging use:
    $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

    Make sure and run the built examples and test from the wolfssl-root to properly find the ./certs directory.

    CMake on Windows with Visual Studio
    1. Open Command Prompt
    2. Run the Visual Studio batch to setup command line variables: Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat
    3. Then use steps above
