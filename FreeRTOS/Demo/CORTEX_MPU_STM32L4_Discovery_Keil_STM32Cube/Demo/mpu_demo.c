/** ARMv7 MPU Details:
 *
 * - ARMv7 MPU requires that the size of a MPU region is a power of 2.
 * - Smallest supported region size is 32 bytes.
 * - Start address of a region must be aligned to an integer multiple of the
 *   region size. For example, if the region size is 4 KB(0x1000), the starting
 *   address must be N x 0x1000, where N is an integer.
