 *
 * The Xilinx interrupt controller driver component. This component supports the
 * Xilinx interrupt controller.
 *
 * The interrupt controller driver uses the idea of priority for the various
 * handlers. Priority is an integer within the range of 0 and 31 inclusive with
 * 0 being the highest priority interrupt source.
 *
 * The Xilinx interrupt controller supports the following features:
 *
 *   - specific individual interrupt enabling/disabling
 *   - specific individual interrupt acknowledging
 *   - attaching specific callback function to handle interrupt source
 *   - master enable/disable
 *   - single callback per interrupt or all pending interrupts handled for
 *     each interrupt of the processor
 *
 * The acknowledgement of the interrupt within the interrupt controller is
 * selectable, either prior to the device's handler being called or after
 * the handler is called. This is necessary to support interrupt signal inputs
 * which are either edge or level signals.  Edge driven interrupt signals
 * require that the interrupt is acknowledged prior to the interrupt being
 * serviced in order to prevent the loss of interrupts which are occurring
 * extremely close together.  A level driven interrupt input signal requires
 * the interrupt to acknowledged after servicing the interrupt to ensure that
 * the interrupt only generates a single interrupt condition.
 *
 * Details about connecting the interrupt handler of the driver are contained
 * in the source file specific to interrupt processing, xintc_intr.c.
 *
 * This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent.  It works with
 * physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads
 * or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be
 * satisfied by the layer above this driver.
 *
 * <b>Interrupt Vector Tables</b>
 *
 * The interrupt vector table for each interrupt controller device is declared
 * statically in xintc_g.c within the configuration data for each instance.
 * The device ID of the interrupt controller device is used by the driver as a
 * direct index into the configuration data table - to retrieve the vector table
 * for an instance of the interrupt controller. The user should populate the
 * vector table with handlers and callbacks at run-time using the XIntc_Connect()
 * and XIntc_Disconnect() functions.
 *
 * Each vector table entry corresponds to a device that can generate an
 * interrupt. Each entry contains an interrupt handler function and an argument
 * to be passed to the handler when an interrupt occurs.  The tools default this
 * argument to the base address of the interrupting device.  Note that the
 * device driver interrupt handlers given in this file do not take a base
 * address as an argument, but instead take a pointer to the driver instance.
 * This means that although the table is created statically, the user must still
 * use XIntc_Connect() when the interrupt handler takes an argument other than
 * the base address. This is only to say that the existence of the static vector
 * tables should not mislead the user into thinking they no longer need to
 * register/connect interrupt handlers with this driver.
 *
 * <pre>
 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- -------------------------------------------------------
 * 1.00a ecm  08/16/01 First release
 * 1.00a rpm  01/09/02 Removed the AckLocation argument from XIntc_Connect().
 *                     This information is now internal in xintc_g.c.
 * 1.00b jhl  02/13/02 Repartitioned the driver for smaller files
 * 1.00b jhl  04/24/02 Made LookupConfig function global and relocated config
 *                     data type
 * 1.00c rpm  10/17/03 New release. Support the static vector table created
 *                     in the xintc_g.c configuration table. Moved vector
 *                     table and options out of instance structure and into
 *                     the configuration table.
 * 1.10c mta  03/21/07 Updated to new coding style
 * 1.11a sv   11/21/07 Updated driver to support access through a DCR bridge
 * 2.00a ktn  10/20/09 Updated to use HAL Processor APIs and _m is removed from
 *		      all the macro names/definitions.
 * 2.01a sdm  04/27/10 Updated the tcl so that the defintions are generated in
 *		      the xparameters.h to know whether the optional registers
 *		      SIE, CIE and IVR are enabled in the HW - Refer CR 555392.
 *		      This driver doesnot make use of these definitions and does
 *		      not use the optional registers.
 * 2.03a hvm  05/24/11 Updated the tcl to generate vector Ids for external
 *		      interrupts. CR565336
 * 2.04a bss  01/13/12 Added XIntc_ConnectFastHandler API for Fast Interrupt
 *		      and XIntc_SetNormalIntrMode for setting to normal
 *		      interrupt mode.
 * 2.04a asa  03/19/12 Changed the XIntc_Config struct. The order of entries
 *		      declared in the structure now matches with the
 *		      XIntc_ConfigTable generated by the driver tcl.
 * 2.05a bss  08/16/12 Updated to support relocatable vectors in Microblaze,
 *		      added IntVectorAddr to XIntc_Config for this.
 *		      Added XIntc_RegisterFastHandler API to register fast
 *		      interrupt handlers using base address.
 * 2.06a bss  01/28/13 To support Cascade mode:
 *            Added XIN_INTC_NOCASCADE,XIN_INTC_PRIMARY,
 *		      XIN_INTC_SECONDARY,XIN_INTC_LAST and
 *		      XIN_CONTROLLER_MAX_INTRS  macros
 *		      Added NumberofIntrs and IntcType fields in XIntc_Config
 *		      structure.
 *		      Modified XIntc_Initialize,XIntc_Start,XIntc_Connect
 *		      XIntc_Disconnect,XIntc_Enable,XIntc_Disable,
 *		      XIntc_Acknowledge,XIntc_ConnectFastHandler and
 *		      XIntc_SetNormalIntrMode APIs.Added XIntc_InitializeSlaves
 *		      API in xintc.c
 *                Modified XIntc_DeviceInterruptHandler,
 *                XIntc_SetIntrSvcOption,XIntc_RegisterHandler and
 *		      XIntc_RegisterFastHandler APIs.Added XIntc_CascadeHandler
 *		      API in xintc_l.c.
 *		      Modified XIntc_SetOptions API in xintc_options.c.
 *		      Modified XIntc_SimulateIntr API in xintc_selftest.c.
 *		      Modified driver tcl:
 *			to check for Cascade mode and generate XPAR_INTC_TYPE
 *			for each controller.
 *			Generate XPAR_INTC_MAX_NUM_INTR_INPUTS by adding all
 *			interrupt sources of all Controllers in Cascade mode.
 * 2.07a bss  10/18/13 To support Nested interrupts:
 *		      Modified XIntc_DeviceInterruptHandler API.
 *		      Added XIN_ILR_OFFSET macro in xintc_l.h.
 *		      Modified driver tcl to generate HAS_ILR parameter in
 *		      xparameters.h
 * 3.0   bss  01/28/13 Modified xintc.c to initialize IVAR register with
 *		      XPAR_MICROBLAZE_BASE_VECTORS + 0x10 to fix
 *		      CR#765931.
 *		      Modified driver tcl to generate XPAR_AXI_INTC_0_TYPE
 *		      correctly(CR#764865).
 *
 * @note
 *		For Cascade mode, Interrupt IDs are generated in xparameters.h
 *		as shown below:
 *
 *	    Master/Primary INTC
 *		 ______
 *		|      |-0      Secondary INTC
 *		|      |-.         ______
 *		|      |-.        |      |-32        Last INTC
 *		|      |-.        |      |-.          ______
 *		|______|<-31------|      |-.         |      |-64
 *			          |      |-.         |      |-.
 *			          |______|<-63-------|      |-.
 *                                                    |      |-.
 *                                                    |______|-95
 *
 *		All driver functions has to be called using DeviceId/
 *		InstancePtr/BaseAddress of Primary/Master Controller and
 *		Interrupts IDs generated in xparameters.h only.
 *		Driver functions takes care of Slave Controllers based on
 *		Interrupt ID passed. User must not use Interrupt source/ID
 *		31 of Primary and Secondary controllers to call driver
 *		functions.
 *
 *		For nested interrupts, XIntc_DeviceInterruptHandler saves
 *		microblaze r14 register on entry and restores on exit. This is
 *		required since compiler does not support nesting. It enables
 *		Microblaze interrupts after blocking further interrupts from
 *		the current interrupt number and interrupts below current
 *		interrupt proirity by writing to Interrupt Level Register of
 *		INTC on entry. On exit, it disables microblaze interrupts and
 *		restores ILR register default value(0xFFFFFFFF)back. It is
 *		recommended to increase STACK_SIZE in linker script for nested
 *		interrupts.
 * 3.0     adk    12/10/13  Updated as per the New Tcl API's
 * 3.0    adk    17/02/14  Fixed the CR:771287 Changes are made in the intc
 *                 driver tcl.
 * 3.1     adk    8/4/14    Fixed the CR:783248 Changes are made in
 *			   the test-app tcl
 * 3.2     bss    4/8/14    Fixed driver tcl to handle external interrupt pins
 *			   correctly (CR#799609).
 * 3.3     adk    11/3/14   added generation of C_HAS_ILR parameter to
 *			   xparameters.h.Changes are made in the driver tcl file
 *			   (CR#828046).
 * 3.5   sk   11/10/15 Used UINTPTR instead of u32 for Baseaddress CR# 867425.
