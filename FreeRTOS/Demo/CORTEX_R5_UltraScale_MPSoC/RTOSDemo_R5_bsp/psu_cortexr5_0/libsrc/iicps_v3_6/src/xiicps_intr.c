 * This function sets the status callback function, the status handler, which the
 * driver calls when it encounters conditions that should be reported to the
 * higher layer software. The handler executes in an interrupt context, so
 * the amount of processing should be minimized
 *
 * Refer to the xiicps.h file for a list of the Callback events. The events are
 * defined to start with XIICPS_EVENT_*.
 *
 * @param	InstancePtr is a pointer to the XIicPs instance.
 * @param	CallBackRef is the upper layer callback reference passed back
 *		when the callback function is invoked.
 * @param	FunctionPtr is the pointer to the callback function.
 *
 * @return	None.
 *
 * @note
 *
 * The handler is called within interrupt context, so it should finish its
 * work quickly.
