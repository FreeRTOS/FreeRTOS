/* ****************************************************************************
 * This project includes a lot of tasks and tests and is therefore complex.
 * If you would prefer a much simpler project to get started with then select
 * the 'Blinky' build configuration within the Embedded Workbench IDE.
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The web
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks,
 * which provide no particular functionality but do provide a good example of
 * how to use the FreeRTOS API.  The tasks defined in flop.c are included in the
 * set of standard demo tasks to ensure the floating point unit gets some
 * exercise.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * Webserver ("uIP") task - This serves a number of dynamically generated WEB
 * pages to a standard WEB browser.  The IP and MAC addresses are configured by
 * constants defined at the bottom of FreeRTOSConfig.h.  Use either a standard
 * Ethernet cable to connect through a hug, or a cross over (point to point)
 * cable to connect directly.  Ensure the IP address used is compatible with the
 * IP address of the machine running the browser - the easiest way to achieve
 * this is to ensure the first three octets of the IP addresses are the same.
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill the registers with known values, then check
 * that each register still contains its expected value.  Each task uses
 * different values.  The tasks run with very low priority so get preempted
 * very frequently.  A check variable is incremented on each iteration of the
 * test loop.  A register containing an unexpected value is indicative of an
 * error in the context switching mechanism and will result in a branch to a
 * null loop - which in turn will prevent the check variable from incrementing
 * any further and allow the check task (described below) to determine that an
 * error has occurred.  The nature of the reg test tasks necessitates that they
 * are written in assembly code.
 *
 * "Check" task - This only executes every five seconds but has a high priority
 * to ensure it gets processor time.  Its main function is to check that all the
 * standard demo tasks are still operational.  While no errors have been
 * discovered the check task will toggle LED 5 every 5 seconds - the toggle
 * rate increasing to 200ms being a visual indication that at least one task has
 * reported unexpected behaviour.
 *
 * "High frequency timer test" - A high frequency periodic interrupt is
 * generated using a timer - the interrupt is assigned a priority above
 * configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY so should not be effected by anything
 * the kernel is doing.  The frequency and priority of the interrupt, in
 * combination with other standard tests executed in this demo, should result
 * in interrupts nesting at least 3 and probably 4 deep.  This test is only
 * included in build configurations that have the optimiser switched on.  In
 * optimised builds the count of high frequency ticks is used as the time base
 * for the run time stats.
 *
 * *NOTE 1* If LED5 is toggling every 5 seconds then all the demo application
 * tasks are executing as expected and no errors have been reported in any
 * tasks.  The toggle rate increasing to 200ms indicates that at least one task
 * has reported unexpected behaviour.
 *
 * *NOTE 2* vApplicationSetupTimerInterrupt() is called by the kernel to let
 * the application set up a timer to generate the tick interrupt.  In this
 * example a compare match timer is used for this purpose.
 *
 * *NOTE 3* The CPU must be in Supervisor mode when the scheduler is started.
 * The PowerON_Reset_PC() supplied in resetprg.c with this demo has
 * Change_PSW_PM_to_UserMode() commented out to ensure this is the case.
 *
 * *NOTE 4* The IntQueue common demo tasks test interrupt nesting and make use
 * of all the 8bit timers (as two cascaded 16bit units).
