/*
 * This demo application file demonstrates the use of queues to pass data
 * between co-routines.
 *
 * N represents the number of 'fixed delay' co-routines that are created and
 * is set during initialisation.
 *
 * N 'fixed delay' co-routines are created that just block for a fixed
 * period then post the number of an LED onto a queue.  Each such co-routine
 * uses a different block period.  A single 'flash' co-routine is also created
 * that blocks on the same queue, waiting for the number of the next LED it
 * should flash.  Upon receiving a number it simply toggle the instructed LED
 * then blocks on the queue once more.  In this manner each LED from LED 0 to
 * LED N-1 is caused to flash at a different rate.
 *
 * The 'fixed delay' co-routines are created with co-routine priority 0.  The
 * flash co-routine is created with co-routine priority 1.  This means that
 * the queue should never contain more than a single item.  This is because
 * posting to the queue will unblock the 'flash' co-routine, and as this has
 * a priority greater than the tasks posting to the queue it is guaranteed to
 * have emptied the queue and blocked once again before the queue can contain
 * any more date.  An error is indicated if an attempt to post data to the
 * queue fails - indicating that the queue is already full.
