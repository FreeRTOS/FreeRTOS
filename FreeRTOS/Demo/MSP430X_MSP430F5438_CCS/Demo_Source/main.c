/*
 * The documentation page for this demo available on http://www.FreeRTOS.org
 * documents the hardware configuration required to run this demo.  It also
 * provides more information on the expected demo application behaviour.
 *
 * main() creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.
 * A lot of the created tasks are from the pool of "standard demo" tasks.  The
 * web documentation provides more details of the standard demo tasks, which
 * provide no particular functionality but do provide good examples of how to
 * use the FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks, interrupts tests
 * and timers are defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "LCD" task - The LCD task is a 'gatekeeper' task.  It is the only task that
 * is permitted to access the LCD and therefore ensures access to the LCD is
 * always serialised and there are no mutual exclusion issues.  When a task or
 * an interrupt wants to write to the LCD, it does not access the LCD directly
 * but instead sends the message to the LCD task.  The LCD task then performs
 * the actual LCD output.  This mechanism also allows interrupts to, in effect,
 * write to the LCD by sending messages to the LCD task.
 *
 * The LCD task is also a demonstration of a 'controller' task design pattern.
 * Some tasks do not actually send a string to the LCD task directly, but
 * instead send a command that is interpreted by the LCD task.  In a normal
 * application these commands can be control values or set points, in this
 * simple example the commands just result in messages being displayed on the
 * LCD.
 *
 * "Button Poll" task - This task polls the state of the 'up' key on the
 * joystick input device.  It uses the vTaskDelay() API function to control
 * the poll rate to ensure debouncing is not necessary and that the task does
 * not use all the available CPU processing time.
 *
 * Button Interrupt - The select button on the joystick input device is 
 * configured to generate an external interrupt.  The handler for this interrupt 
 * sends a message to LCD task, which then prints out a string to say the 
 * joystick select button was pressed.
 *
 * Idle Hook - The idle hook is a function that is called on each iteration of
 * the idle task.  In this case it is used to place the processor into a low
 * power mode.  Note however that this application is implemented using standard
 * components, and is therefore not optimised for low power operation.  Lower
 * power consumption would be achieved by converting polling tasks into event
 * driven tasks, and slowing the tick interrupt frequency, etc.
 *
 * "Check" callback function - Called each time the 'check' timer expires.  The
 * check timer executes every five seconds.  Its main function is to check that 
 * all the standard demo tasks are still operational.  Each time it executes it 
 * sends a status code to the LCD task.  The LCD task interprets the code and 
 * displays an appropriate message - which will be PASS if no tasks have 
 * reported any errors, or a message stating which task has reported an error.
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill the registers with known values, then check
 * that each register still contains its expected value.  Each task uses
 * different values.  The tasks run with very low priority so get preempted
 * very frequently.  A check variable is incremented on each iteration of the
 * test loop.  A register containing an unexpected value is indicative of an
 * error in the context switching mechanism and will result in a branch to a
 * null loop - which in turn will prevent the check variable from incrementing
 * any further and allow the check timer callback (described a above) to 
 * determine that an error has occurred.  The nature of the reg test tasks 
 * necessitates that they are written in assembly code.
 *
 * Tick hook function - called inside the RTOS tick function, this simple 
 * example does nothing but toggle an LED.
 *
 * *NOTE 1* vApplicationSetupTimerInterrupt() is called by the kernel to let
 * the application set up a timer to generate the tick interrupt.  In this
 * example a timer A0 is used for this purpose.
