/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting (defined in this file) is used to
 * select between the two.  The simply blinky demo is implemented and described
 * in main_blinky.c.  The more comprehensive test and demo application is
 * implemented and described in main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.
 *
 * 
 * Additional code:
 * 
 * This demo does not contain a non-kernel interrupt service routine that
 * can be used as an example for application writers to use as a reference.
 * Therefore, the framework of a dummy (not installed) handler is provided
 * in this file.  The dummy function is called Dummy_IRQHandler().  Please
 * ensure to read the comments in the function itself, but more importantly,
 * the notes on the function contained on the documentation page for this demo
 * that is found on the FreeRTOS.org web site.
