 *
 *  @brief      SDHost driver implementation for CC32XX devices.
 *
 *  The SDHost header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/SD.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/sd/SDHostCC32XX.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref SD.h for a complete description of APIs & example of use.
 *
 *  This SDHost driver implementation is designed to operate on a CC32XX
 *  SD Host controller using a micro DMA controller.
 *
 *  Note: The driver API's are not thread safe and must not be accessed through
 *      multiple threads without the use of mutexes.
 *
 *  ## DMA buffer alignment #
 *
 *  When performing disk operations with a word aligned buffer the driver will
 *  make transfers using the DMA controller. Alternatively, if the buffer is
 *  not aligned, the data will be copied to the internal SD Host controller
 *  buffer using a polling method.
 *
 *  ## DMA Interrupts #
 *
 *  When DMA is used, the micro DMA controller generates and IRQ on the
 *  perpheral's interrupt vector. This implementation automatically installs
 *  a DMA interrupt to service the assigned micro DMA channels.
 *
 *  ## DMA accessible memory #
 *
 *  When DMA is used, it is the responsibility of the application to ensure
 *  that read/write buffers reside in memory that is accessible by the DMA.
 *

 *  @brief  SDHostCC32XX Hardware attributes
 *
 *  The SDHostCC32XX configuration structure is passed to the SDHostCC32XX
 *  driver implementation with hardware specifics regarding GPIO Pins and Ports
 *  to be used.
 *
 *  The SDHostCC32XX driver uses this information to:
 *  - Configure and reconfigure specific ports/pins to initialize the SD Card
 *    for SD mode
 *  - Identify which GPIO port and pin is used for the SDHost clock, data and
 *    command lines
 *
 *  These fields are used by driverlib APIs and therefore must be populated by
 *  driverlib macro definitions. For CC32xxWare these definitions are found in:
 *      - inc/hw_memmap.h
 *      - driverlib/pin.h
 *
 *  @struct SDHostCC32XX_HWAttrs
 *  An example configuration structure could look as the following:
 *  @code
 *  const SDHostCC32XX_HWAttrsV1 sdhostCC32XXHWattrs[] = {
 *      {
 *          .clkRate = 8000000,
 *          .intPriority = ~0,
 *          .baseAddr = SDHOST_BASE,
 *          .rxChIdx = UDMA_CH23_SDHOST_RX,
 *          .txChIdx = UDMA_CH24_SDHOST_TX,
 *          .dataPin = SDHostCC32XX_PIN_06_SDCARD_DATA,
 *          .cmdPin = SDHostCC32XX_PIN_08_SDCARD_CMD,
 *          .clkPin = SDHostCC32XX_PIN_07_SDCARD_CLK,
 *      }
 *  };
 *  @endcode
