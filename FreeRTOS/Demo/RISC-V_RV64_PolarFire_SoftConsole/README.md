## UART configuration
On connecting Icicle kit J11 to the host PC, you should see four COM port
interfaces connected. This example project uses MMUART0. To use this
project the host PC must connect to the COM port interface0 using a terminal
emulator such as HyperTerminal or PuTTY configured as follows:

   - 115200 baud.
   - 8 data bits.
   - 1 stop bit.
   - no parity.
   - no flow control.
