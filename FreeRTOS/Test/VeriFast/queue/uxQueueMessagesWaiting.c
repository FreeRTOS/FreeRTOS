/* It may seem that the read of `pxQueue->uxMessagesWaiting` is required to be
 * contained in a critical region to be thread-safe. However, it is impossible for
 * this read to be involved in a data race due to the atomicity mechanism used by
 * tasks and ISRs: masking and enabling interrupts. If we assume (1) a
 * uniprocessor system and (2) that higher priority ISRs never call queue API
 * functions then masking interrupts ensures *strong isolation* meaning critical
 * regions protected by interrupt masking/enabling are isolated from other
 * critical regions and code outside of critical regions. */
