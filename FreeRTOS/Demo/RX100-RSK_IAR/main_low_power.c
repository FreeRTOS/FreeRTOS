/* ****************************************************************************
 * When configCREATE_LOW_POWER_DEMO is set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h main() will
 * call main_low_power(), which is defined in this file.  main_low_power()
 * demonstrates FreeRTOS tick suppression being used to allow the MCU to be
 * placed into both the low power deep sleep mode and the low power software
 * standby mode.  When configCREATE_LOW_POWER_DEMO is set to 0 main will
 * instead call main_full(), which is a more comprehensive RTOS demonstration.
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 * This application demonstrates the FreeRTOS tickless idle mode (tick
 * suppression).  See http://www.freertos.org/low-power-tickless-rtos.html
 * The demo is configured to execute on the Renesas RX100 RSK.
 *
 *  Functionality:
 *
 *  + Two tasks are created, an Rx task and a Tx task.
 *
 *  + The Rx task repeatedly blocks on a queue to wait for data.  The Rx task
 *    toggles LED 0 each time is receives a value from the queue.
 *
 *  + The Tx task repeatedly enters the Blocked state for an amount of time
 *    that is set by the position of the potentiometer.  On exiting the blocked
 *    state the Tx task sends a value through the queue to the Rx task (causing
 *    the Rx task to exit the blocked state and toggle LED 0).
 *
 *    If the value read from the potentiometer is less than or equal to
 *    mainSOFTWARE_STANDBY_DELAY then the Tx task blocks for the equivalent
 *    number of milliseconds.  For example, if the sampled analog value is
 *    2000, then the Tx task blocks for 2000ms.  Blocking for a finite period
 *    allows the kernel to stop the tick interrupt and place the RX100 into
 *    deep sleep mode.
 *
 *    If the value read form the potentiometer is greater than
 *    mainSOFTWARE_STANDBY_DELAY then the Tx task blocks on a semaphore with
 *    an infinite timeout.  Blocking with an infinite timeout allows the kernel
 *    to stop the tick interrupt and place the RX100 into software standby
 *    mode.  Pressing a button will generate an interrupt that causes the RX100
 *    to exit software standby mode.  The interrupt service routine 'gives' the
 *    semaphore to unblock the Tx task.
 *
 *
 *  Using the Demo and Observed Behaviour:
 *
 *  1) Turn the potentiometer completely counter clockwise.
 *
 *  2) Program the RX100 with the application, then disconnect the programming/
 *   debugging hardware to ensure power readings are not effected by any
 *   connected interfaces.
 *
 *  3) Start the application running.  LED 0 will toggle quickly because the
 *   potentiometer is turned to its lowest value.  LED 1 will be illuminated
 *   when the RX100 is not in a power saving mode, but will appear to be off
 *   because most execution time is spent in a sleep mode.  Led 2 will be
 *   illuminated when the RX100 is in deep sleep mode, and will appear to be
 *   always on, again because most execution time is spent in deep sleep mode.
 *   The LEDs are turned on and off by the application defined pre and post
 *   sleep macros (see the definitions of configPRE_SLEEP_PROCESSING() and
 *   configPOST_SLEEP_PROCESSING() in FreeRTOSConfig.h).
 *
 *  4) Slowly turn the potentiometer in the clockwise direction.  This will
 *   increase the value read from the potentiometer, which will increase the
 *   time the Tx task spends in the Blocked state, which will therefore
 *   decrease the frequency at which the Tx task sends data to the queue (and
 *   the rate at which LED 0 is toggled).
 *
 *  5) Keep turning the potentiometer in the clockwise direction.  Eventually
 *   the value read from the potentiometer will go above
 *   mainSOFTWARE_STANDBY_DELAY, causing the Tx task to block on the semaphore
 *   with an infinite timeout.  LED 0 will stop toggling because the Tx task is
 *   no longer sending to the queue.  LED 1 and LED 2 will both be off because
 *   the RX100 is neither running or in deep sleep mode (it is in software
 *   standby mode).
 *
 *  6) Turn the potentiometer counter clockwise again to ensure its value goes
 *   back below mainSOFTWARE_STANDBY_DELAY.
 *
 *  7) Press any of the three buttons to generate an interrupt.  The interrupt
 *   will take the RX100 out of software standby mode, and the interrupt
 *   service routine will unblock the Tx task by 'giving' the semaphore.  LED 0
 *   will then start to toggle again.
