/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks,
 * which provide no particular functionality but do provide a good example of
 * how to use the FreeRTOS API.  In addition to the standard demo tasks, the 
 * following tasks and tests are defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * Webserver ("uIP") task - This serves a number of dynamically generated WEB
 * pages to a standard WEB browser.  The IP and MAC addresses are configured by
 * constants defined at the bottom of FreeRTOSConfig.h.  Use either a standard
 * Ethernet cable to connect through a hug, or a cross over (point to point)
 * cable to connect directly.  Ensure the IP address used is compatible with the
 * IP address of the machine running the browser - the easiest way to achieve
 * this is to ensure the first three octets of the IP addresses are the same.
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill the registers with known values, then check
 * that each register still contains its expected value.  Each task uses
 * different values.  The tasks run with very low priority so get preempted very
 * frequently.  A register containing an unexpected value is indicative of an
 * error in the context switching mechanism.  Both standard and floating point
 * registers are checked.  The nature of the reg test tasks necessitates that
 * they are written in assembly code.  They are defined in regtest.src.
 *
 * "math" tasks - These are a set of 8 tasks that perform various double
 * precision floating point calculations in order to check that the tasks 
 * floating point registers are being correctly saved and restored during
 * context switches.  The math tasks are defined in flop.c.
 *
 * "Check" task - This only executes every five seconds but has a high priority
 * to ensure it gets processor time.  Its main function is to check that all the
 * standard demo tasks are still operational.  While no errors have been
 * discovered the check task will toggle an LED every 5 seconds - the toggle
 * rate increasing to 200ms being a visual indication that at least one task has
 * reported unexpected behaviour.
 *
 * *NOTE 1* If LED5 is toggling every 5 seconds then all the demo application
 * tasks are executing as expected and no errors have been reported in any 
 * tasks.  The toggle rate increasing to 200ms indicates that at least one task
 * has reported unexpected behaviour.
 * 
 * *NOTE 2* This file and flop.c both demonstrate the use of 
 * xPortUsesFloatingPoint() which informs the kernel that a task should maintain
 * a floating point context.
 *
 * *NOTE 3* vApplicationSetupTimerInterrupt() is called by the kernel to let
 * the application set up a timer to generate the tick interrupt.  In this
 * example a compare match timer is used for this purpose.  
 * vApplicationTickHook() is used to clear the timer interrupt and relies on
 * configUSE_TICK_HOOK being set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.
 *
 * *NOTE 4* The traceTASK_SWITCHED_IN and traceTASK_SWITCHED_OUT trace hooks
 * are used to save and restore the floating point context respectively for
 * those tasks that require it (those for which xPortUsesFloatingPoint() has
 * been called).
 * 
 * *NOTE 5* Any interrupt that can cause a context switch requires an asm 
 * wrapper and must be assigned an interrupt priority of 
 * portKERNEL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY.
 *
 * *NOTE 6* vSetupClockForRunTimeStats() is called by the kernel (via the 
 * portCONFIGURE_TIMER_FOR_RUN_TIME_STATS()) macro to configure an MTU channel
 * to produce a time base that is used to log how much processor time each task
 * is consuming.  The MTU is used to generate a high(ish) frequency interrupt,
 * and so also provides an example of how interrupts that don't make use of the
 * FreeRTOS kernel can be assigned a priority above any priority used by the
 * kernel itself.
