 * @addtogroup a53_errata Cortex A53 64 bit Processor Errata Support
 * @{
 * Various ARM errata are handled in the standalone BSP. The implementation for
 * errata handling follows ARM guidelines and is based on the open source Linux
 * support for these errata.
 *
 * @note
 * The errata handling is enabled by default. To disable handling of all the
 * errata globally, un-define the macro ENABLE_ARM_ERRATA in xil_errata.h. To
 * disable errata on a per-erratum basis, un-define relevant macros in
 * xil_errata.h.
