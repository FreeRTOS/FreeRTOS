 * Run a self-test on the driver/device. This function does a minimal test
 * in which the data register is read. It only does a read without any kind
 * of test because the hardware has been parameterized such that it may be only
 * an input such that the state of the inputs won't be known.
 *
 * All other hardware features of the device are not guaranteed to be in the
 * hardware since they are parameterizable.
 *
 *
 * @param	InstancePtr is a pointer to the XGpio instance to be worked on.
 *		This parameter must have been previously initialized with
 *		XGpio_Initialize().
 *
 * @return  XST_SUCCESS always. If the GPIO device was not present in the
 *		hardware a bus error could be generated. Other indicators of a
 *		bus error, such as registers in bridges or buses, may be
 *		necessary to determine if this function caused a bus error.
 *
 * @note		None.
