    Porting Note:

    If you are lucky, you can use one of these implementations; otherwise, these
    can serve as examples of how to implement this service.

/** @brief The F_DRIVER example implementation.

    This implementation is designed to reuse an existing block device driver
    that was written for FreeRTOS+FAT SL.  If you have such a driver, with
    little work it can be "dropped in" and used for Reliance Edge.  The only
    customization required is that gpfnRedOsBDevInit needs to be defined and
    pointed at the F_DRIVERINIT function.  This can be done in this module or in
    another C file.

    The disadantage of using the FreeRTOS F_DRIVER functions is that they only
    support single-sector reads and writes.  Reliance Edge will issue
    multi-sector requests, and servicing these one sector at a time will
    significantly slow down the file system.
*/

/** @brief The FatFs example implementation.

    This implementation is designed to reuse an existing block device driver
    that was written for FatFs.  If you have such a driver, it can be linked
    in and used immediately.  The FatFs `diskio.h` header must be in the include
    directory path.

/** @brief The Atmel Studio Framework SD/MMC driver example implementation.

    This implementation uses a modified version of the open source SD/MMC driver
    included in the Atmel Studio Framework (ASF) and will work as-is for many
    varieties of Atmel hardware.  This example assumes relatively minor
    modifications to the ASF SD/MMC driver to make it support multi-sector read
    and write requests, which greatly improves performance.  The modified driver
    is distributed with Reliance Edge and is included in FreeRTOS Atmel projects
    (such as in projects/freertos/atmel/sam4e-ek/src/ASF).

    This example can easily be modified to work with an unmodified version of
    the ASF SD/MMC driver.  Simply replace sd_mmc_mem_2_ram_multi() and
    sd_mmc_ram_2_mem_multi() with sd_mmc_mem_2_ram() and sd_mmc_ram_2_mem()
    respectively, and add a for loop to loop over each sector in the request.
    However, as described in the manual, there are considerable performance
    advantages to issuing real multi-sector requests, so using the modified
    driver is recommended.
