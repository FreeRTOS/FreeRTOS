 *
 *  @brief      Timer driver interface
 *
 *  The Timer header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/Timer.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *  The Timer driver operates as a generic timer interface for timing interval
 *  handling. It can be configured to run in one-shot blocking mode,
 *  one-shot callback mode, continuous callback mode, or free-run mode. This
 *  driver does not have PWM or capture functionalities. These functionalities
 *  are addressed in both the Capture and PWM driver modules.
 *
 *  The Timer driver also handles the general purpose timer resource allocation.
 *  For the driver that requires to use the general purpose timer, it calls
 *  Timer_open() to occupy the specified timer, and calls Timer_close() to release
 *  the occupied timer resource.
 *
 *  ## Opening the Driver ##
 *
 *  @code
 *  Timer_Handle      handle;
 *  Timer_Params      params;
 *
 *  Timer_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.mode  = TIMER_MODE_CONTINUOUS_CALLBACK;
 *  params.callbackFxn = someTimerCallbackFunction;
 *  params.periodUnit = TIMER_PERIOD_US;
 *  params.period = 5000000
 *  handle = Timer_open(someTimer_configIndexValue, &params);
 *  if (!handle)
 *  {
 *      System_printf("Timer did not open");
 *  }
 *
 *  ## Starting the Driver ##
 *
 *  @code
 *  status = Timer_start(handle);
 *  if (status == TIMER_STATUS_ERROR)
 *  {
 *      System_printf("Timer cannot start at specified period");
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## Stopping the driver ##
 *
 *  @code
 *  Timer_stop(handle);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## closing the driver ##
 *
 *  @code
 *  Timer_close(handle);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  This module serves as the main interface for TI Drivers
 *  applications. Its purpose is to redirect the module's APIs to specific
 *  peripheral implementations which are specified using a pointer to a
 *  Timer_FxnTable.
 *
 *  The Timer driver interface module is joined (at link time) to a
 *  NULL-terminated array of Timer_Config data structures named *Timer_config*.
 *  *Timer_config* is implemented in the application with each entry being an
 *  instance of a Timer peripheral. Each entry in *Timer_config* contains a:
 *  - (Timer_FxnTable *) to a set of functions that implement a Timer peripheral
 *  - (void *) data object that is associated with the Timer_FxnTable
 *  - (void *) hardware attributes that are associated to the Timer_FxnTable
 *
 *  # Instrumentation #
 *  The Timer driver interface produces log statements if instrumentation is
 *  enabled.
 *
