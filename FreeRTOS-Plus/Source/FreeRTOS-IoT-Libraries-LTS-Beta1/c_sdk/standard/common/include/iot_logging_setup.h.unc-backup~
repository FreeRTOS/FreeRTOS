/**
 * @def IotLog( messageLevel, pLogConfig, ... )
 * @brief Logging function for a specific library. In most cases, this is the
 * logging function to call.
 *
 * This function prints a single log message. It is available when @ref
 * LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL is not #IOT_LOG_NONE. Log messages automatically
 * include the [log level](@ref logging_constants_levels), [library name]
 * (@ref LIBRARY_LOG_NAME), and time. An optional @ref IotLogConfig_t may
 * be passed to this function to hide information for a single log message.
 *
 * The logging library must be set up before this function may be called. See
 * @ref logging_setup_use for more information.
 *
 * This logging function also has the following abbreviated forms that can be used
 * when an #IotLogConfig_t isn't needed.
 *
 * Name         | Equivalent to
 * ----         | -------------
 * #IotLogError | @code{c} IotLog( IOT_LOG_ERROR, NULL, ... ) @endcode
 * #IotLogWarn  | @code{c} IotLog( IOT_LOG_WARN, NULL, ... ) @endcode
 * #IotLogInfo  | @code{c} IotLog( IOT_LOG_INFO, NULL, ... ) @endcode
 * #IotLogDebug | @code{c} IotLog( IOT_LOG_DEBUG, NULL, ... ) @endcode
 *
 * @param[in] messageLevel Log level of this message. Must be one of the
 * @ref logging_constants_levels.
 * @param[in] pLogConfig Pointer to an #IotLogConfig_t. Optional; pass `NULL`
 * to ignore.
 * @param[in] ... Message and format specification.
 *
 * @return No return value. On errors, it prints nothing.
 *
 * @note This function may be implemented as a macro.
 * @see @ref logging_function_generic for the generic (not library-specific)
 * logging function.

/**
 * @def IotLog_PrintBuffer( pHeader, pBuffer, bufferSize )
 * @brief Log the contents of buffer as bytes. Only available when @ref
 * LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL is #IOT_LOG_DEBUG.
 *
 * This function prints the bytes located at a given memory address. It is
 * intended for debugging only, and is therefore only available when @ref
 * LIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL is #IOT_LOG_DEBUG.
 *
 * Log messages printed by this function <b>always</b> include the [log level]
 * (@ref logging_constants_levels), [library name](@ref LIBRARY_LOG_NAME),
 * and time.  In addition, this function may print an optional header `pHeader`
 * before it prints the contents of the buffer. This function does not have an
 * #IotLogConfig_t parameter.
 *
 * The logging library must be set up before this function may be called. See
 * @ref logging_setup_use for more information.
 *
 * @param[in] pHeader A message to log before the buffer. Optional; pass `NULL`
 * to ignore.
 * @param[in] pBuffer Pointer to start of buffer.
 * @param[in] bufferSize Size of `pBuffer`.
 *
 * @return No return value. On errors, it prints nothing.
 *
 * @note This function may be implemented as a macro.
 * @note To conserve memory, @ref logging_function_genericprintbuffer (the underlying
 * implementation) only allocates enough memory for a single line of output. Therefore,
 * in multithreaded systems, its output may appear "fragmented" if other threads are
 * logging simultaneously.
 * @see @ref logging_function_genericprintbuffer for the generic (not library-specific)
 * buffer logging function.
 *
 * <b>Example</b>
 * @code{c}
 * const uint8_t pBuffer[] = { 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 };
 *
 * IotLog_PrintBuffer( "This buffer contains:",
 *                     pBuffer,
 *                     4 );
 * @endcode
 * The code above prints something like the following:
 * @code{c}
 * [DEBUG][LIB_NAME][2018-01-01 12:00:00] This buffer contains:
 * 00 01 02 03
 * @endcode
