# TCP Echo Client Demo for MPS2 Cortex-M3 AN385 emulated using QEMU with UserMode Networking
This FreeRTOS+TCP example demonstrates a TCP Echo Client which sends
echo requests to an Echo Server and then receives the echo reply. The
Echo Client runs on the MPS2 Cortex-M3 AN385 platform emulated using QEMU.

## Setup Description
The demo requires 2 components -
1. Echo Client - The demo in this repository.
1. Echo Server - An echo server.

```

## Launch Echo Server
Launch Echo Server on the host machine.
### Host OS is Linux
* Install `netcat`:
   ```
   sudo apt install netcat
   ```
* Start an Echo Server on port 7:
   ```shell
   sudo nc -l 7
   ```

### Host OS is Windows
* Install [Npcap/Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html#windows).
* Start an Echo Server on port 7:
    ```shell
    ncat -l 7
    ```

### Host OS is Mac
* Install `netcat`:
   ```shell
   brew install netcat
   ```
* Start an Echo Server on port 7:
    ```shell
    nc -l -p 7
    ```

## Enable User Networking in QEMU

The User Networking is implemented using *slirp*, which provides a full TCP/IP stack within QEMU and uses that stack to implement a virtual NAT network. It does not require Administrator privileges.

User Mode Networking has the following limitations:

 - There is a lot of overhead, so the performance is poor.
 - In general, ICMP traffic does not work (so you cannot use ping within a guest).
 - On Linux hosts, ping does work from within the guest, but it needs initial setup by root (once per host).
 - The guest is not directly accessible from the host or the external network.

Do the following steps:

1. Pick a MAC address for the QEMU. Define a shell variable `QEMU_MAC_ADDRESS`
and set its value to the picked MAC Address. For example, run the following
command if you picked `52:54:00:12:34:AD`:
```shell
export QEMU_MAC_ADDRESS=52:54:00:12:34:AD
```

2. Set `configMAC_ADDR0`-`configMAC_ADDR5` in `FreeRTOSConfig.h` to the value
of `QEMU_MAC_ADDRESS`:
```shell
echo $QEMU_MAC_ADDRESS
```
```c
#define configMAC_ADDR0         0x52
#define configMAC_ADDR1         0x54
#define configMAC_ADDR2         0x00
#define configMAC_ADDR3         0x12
#define configMAC_ADDR4         0x34
#define configMAC_ADDR5         0xAD
```

3. Define a shell variable `ECHO_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` and set its value to the
IP address of the Echo Server which is running on the host. For example,
run the following command if the IP address of the Echo Server is
`192.168.76.2`:
```shell
export ECHO_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS=192.168.76.2
```

4. Set `configECHO_SERVER_ADDR0`-`configECHO_SERVER_ADDR3` in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`
to the value of `ECHO_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS`:

```c
#define configECHO_SERVER_ADDR0 192
#define configECHO_SERVER_ADDR1 168
#define configECHO_SERVER_ADDR2 76
#define configECHO_SERVER_ADDR3 2
```

5. Build:
```shell
   make
```

6. Run:
```shell
      qemu-system-arm -machine mps2-an385 -cpu cortex-m3 â€”kernel
      build/freertos_tcp_mps2_demo.axf -monitor null -semihosting
      -semihosting-config enable=on,target=native -serial stdio -nographic
      -netdev user,id=mynet0,net=192.168.76.0/24,dhcpstart=192.168.76.9 -net
      nic,macaddr=$QEMU_MAC_ADDRESS,model=lan9118,netdev=mynet0
```
Adding the following
`-netdev user,id=mynet0,net=192.168.76.0/24,dhcpstart=192.168.76.9` to the qemu command line changes the network configuration to use 192.168.76.0/24 instead of the default (10.0.2.0/24) and starts guest DHCP allocation from 9 (instead of 15).

7. You should see that following output on the terminal of the Echo Server (which
is running `sudo nc -l 7` or `netcat -l 7` depending on your OS):
```
0FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~0123456789:;<=> ?
@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~0123456789:;<=>?
@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~0123456789:;<=>?
@ABCDEFGHIJKLM
```
