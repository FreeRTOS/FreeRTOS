 *  @brief  I2CCC32XX Hardware attributes
 *
 *  The baseAddr and intNum fields define the base address and interrupt number
 *  of the I2C peripheral.  These values are used by driverlib APIs and
 *  therefore must be populated by driverlib macro definitions. These
 *  definitions are found in the header files:
 *      - inc/hw_memmap.h
 *      - inc/hw_ints.h
 *
 *  intPriority is the I2C peripheral's interrupt priority.
 *  This driver uses the ti.dpl interface instead of making OS calls directly,
 *  and the corresponding HwiP port handles the interrupt priority in an
 *  OS-specific way.  For example, in the case of the TI-RTOS kernel port,
 *  the intPriority is passed unmodified to Hwi_create() provided by the
 *  ti.sysbios.family.arm.m3.Hwi module; so the documentation for the
 *  ti.sysbios.family.arm.m3.Hwi module should be referenced for a description
 *  of usage of priority.
 *
 *  clkPin and dataPin define the pin multiplexing to be used for the SCL and
 *  SDA pins, respectively.  Macro values defined in this header file should
 *  be used for these fields.
 *
 *  A sample structure is shown below:
 *  @code
 *  const I2CCC32XX_HWAttrsV1 i2cCC32XXHWAttrs[] = {
 *      {
 *          .baseAddr = I2CA0_BASE,
 *          .intNum = INT_I2CA0,
 *          .intPriority = (~0),
 *          .clkPin = I2CCC32XX_PIN_01_I2C_SCL,
 *          .dataPin = I2CCC32XX_PIN_02_I2C_SDA,
 *      }
 *  };
 *  @endcode
