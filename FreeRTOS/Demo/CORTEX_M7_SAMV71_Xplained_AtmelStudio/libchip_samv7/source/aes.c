/** \addtogroup aes_module Working with AES
 * \ingroup peripherals_module
 * The AES driver provides the interface to configure and use the AES peripheral.
 * \n
 *
 * The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specifies a FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithm
 * that can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm is a symmetric block 
 * cipher that can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information.
 * Encryption converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext. 
 * Decrypting the ciphertext converts the data back into its original form, 
 * called plaintext. The CIPHER bit in the AES Mode Register (AES_MR) allows selection 
 * between the encryption and the decryption processes. The AES is capable of using cryptographic 
 * keys of 128/192/256 bits to encrypt and decrypt data in blocks of 128 bits. 
 * This 128-bit/192-bit/256-bit key is defined in the Key Registers (AES_KEYWRx) and set by 
 * AES_WriteKey(). The input to the encryption processes of the CBC, CFB, and OFB modes includes,
 * in addition to the plaintext, a 128-bit data block called the initialization vector (IV), 
 * which must be set with AES_SetVector(). 
 * The initialization vector is used in an initial step in the encryption of a message and 
 * in the corresponding decryption of the message. The Initialization Vector Registers are 
 * also used by the CTR mode to set the counter value.
 *
 * To Enable a AES encryption and decryption,the user has to follow these few steps:
 * <ul>
 * <li> A software triggered hardware reset of the AES interface is performed by AES_SoftReset().</li>
 * <li> Configure AES algorithm mode, key mode, start mode and operation mode by AES_Configure(). </li>
 * <li> Input AES data for encryption and decryption with function AES_SetInput() </li>
 * <li> Set AES key with function AES_WriteKey(). </li>
 * <li> To start the encryption or the decryption process with AES_Start()</li>
 * <li> To get the encryption or decryption result by AES_GetOutput() </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * For more accurate information, please look at the AES section of the
 * Datasheet.
