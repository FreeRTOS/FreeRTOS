 * "Reg tests" - These tests fill the registers with known values, then check
 * that each register maintains its expected value for the lifetime of the
 * task.  Each task uses a different set of values.  The reg test tasks execute
 * with a very low priority, so get preempted very frequently.  A register
 * containing an unexpected value is indicative of an error in the context
 * switching mechanism.
