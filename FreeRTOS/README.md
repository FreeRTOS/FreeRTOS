## Directories:

+ The **FreeRTOS/Source** directory contains the FreeRTOS source code, and contains
  its own readme file.

+ The **FreeRTOS/Demo** directory contains a demo application for every official
FreeRTOS port, and contains its own readme file.

+ The **FreeRTOS/Test** directory contains the tests performed on common code and the portable layer code, and contains its own readme file.

See [FreeRTOS/SourceOrganization](http://www.freertos.org/a00017.html) for full details of the directory structure and information on locating the files you require.

The easiest way to use FreeRTOS is to start with one of the pre-configured demo 
application projects (found in the FreeRTOS/Demo directory).  That way you will
have the correct FreeRTOS source files included, and the correct include paths
configured.  
Once a demo application is building and executing you can remove
the demo application file, and start to add in your own application source
files.
