/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the comprehensive test and demo version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * full demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware, are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_full() creates a set of standard demo tasks (including a set of tasks
 * that test the interrupt nesting behaviour), some application specific tasks,
 * and a timer.  It then starts the scheduler.  The web documentation provides
 * more details of the standard demo application tasks, which provide no
 * particular functionality, but do provide a good example of how to use the
 * FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * The interrupt nesting test tasks require that two timers are configured to
 * generate interrupts.  The interrupt service routines are defined in
 * IntQueueTimer.c, and can be used as examples for application writers.  They
 * do not, however, directly demonstrate the use of FreeRTOS safe API functions
 * (those that end in "FromISR").  Therefore, a dummy interrupt implementation
 * called Dummy_IRQHandler() is provided at the end of main.c.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and timer are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill the registers with known values, then check
 * that each register maintains its expected value for the lifetime of the
 * task.  Each task uses a different set of values.  The reg test tasks execute
 * with a very low priority, so get preempted very frequently.  A register
 * containing an unexpected value is indicative of an error in the context
 * switching mechanism.
 *
 * "Check" software timer - The check timer period is initially set to three
 * seconds.  Its callback function checks that all the standard demo tasks, and
 * the register check tasks, are not only still executing, but are executing
 * without reporting any errors.  If the check timer callback discovers that a
 * task has either stalled, or reported an error, then it changes the period of
 * the check timer from the initial three seconds, to just 200ms.  The callback
 * function also toggles the LED each time it is called.  This provides a visual
 * indication of the system status:  If the LED toggles every three seconds,
 * then no issues have been discovered.  If the LED toggles every 200ms, then
 * an issue has been discovered with at least one task.
