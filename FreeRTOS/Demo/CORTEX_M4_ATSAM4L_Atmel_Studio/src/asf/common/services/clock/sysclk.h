 *
 * See \ref sysclk_quickstart.
 *
 * The <em>sysclk</em> API covers the <em>system clock</em> and all
 * clocks derived from it. The system clock is a chip-internal clock on
 * which all <em>synchronous clocks</em>, i.e. CPU and bus/peripheral
 * clocks, are based. The system clock is typically generated from one
 * of a variety of sources, which may include crystal and RC oscillators
 * as well as PLLs.  The clocks derived from the system clock are
 * sometimes also known as <em>synchronous clocks</em>, since they
 * always run synchronously with respect to each other, as opposed to
 * <em>generic clocks</em> which may run from different oscillators or
 * PLLs.
 *
 * Most applications should simply call sysclk_init() to initialize
 * everything related to the system clock and its source (oscillator,
 * PLL or DFLL), and leave it at that. More advanced applications, and
 * platform-specific drivers, may require additional services from the
 * clock system, some of which may be platform-specific.
 *
 * \section sysclk_group_platform Platform Dependencies
 *
 * The sysclk API is partially chip- or platform-specific. While all
 * platforms provide mostly the same functionality, there are some
 * variations around how different bus types and clock tree structures
 * are handled.
 *
 * The following functions are available on all platforms with the same
 * parameters and functionality. These functions may be called freely by
 * portable applications, drivers and services:
 *   - sysclk_init()
 *   - sysclk_set_source()
 *   - sysclk_get_main_hz()
 *   - sysclk_get_cpu_hz()
 *   - sysclk_get_peripheral_bus_hz()
 *
 * The following functions are available on all platforms, but there may
 * be variations in the function signature (i.e. parameters) and
 * behavior. These functions are typically called by platform-specific
 * parts of drivers, and applications that aren't intended to be
 * portable:
 *   - sysclk_enable_peripheral_clock()
 *   - sysclk_disable_peripheral_clock()
 *   - sysclk_enable_module()
 *   - sysclk_disable_module()
 *   - sysclk_module_is_enabled()
 *   - sysclk_set_prescalers()
 *
 * All other functions should be considered platform-specific.
 * Enabling/disabling clocks to specific peripherals as well as
 * determining the speed of these clocks should be done by calling
 * functions provided by the driver for that peripheral.

/**
 * \fn void sysclk_init(void)
 * \brief Initialize the synchronous clock system.
 *
 * This function will initialize the system clock and its source. This
 * includes:
 *   - Mask all synchronous clocks except for any clocks which are
 *     essential for normal operation (for example internal memory
 *     clocks).
 *   - Set up the system clock prescalers as specified by the
 *     application's configuration file.
 *   - Enable the clock source specified by the application's
 *     configuration file (oscillator or PLL) and wait for it to become
 *     stable.
 *   - Set the main system clock source to the clock specified by the
 *     application's configuration file.
 *
 * Since all non-essential peripheral clocks are initially disabled, it
 * is the responsibility of the peripheral driver to re-enable any
 * clocks that are needed for normal operation.
