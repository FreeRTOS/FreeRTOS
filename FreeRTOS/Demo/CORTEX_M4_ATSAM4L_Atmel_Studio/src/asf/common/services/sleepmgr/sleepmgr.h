/**
 * \defgroup sleepmgr_group Sleep manager
 *
 * The sleep manager is a service for ensuring that the device is not put to
 * sleep in deeper sleep modes than the system (e.g., peripheral drivers,
 * services or the application) allows at any given time.
 *
 * It is based on the use of lock counting for the individual sleep modes, and
 * will put the device to sleep in the shallowest sleep mode that has a non-zero
 * lock count. The drivers/services/application can change these counts by use
 * of \ref sleepmgr_lock_mode and \ref sleepmgr_unlock_mode.
 * Refer to \ref sleepmgr_mode for a list of the sleep modes available for
 * locking, and the device datasheet for information on their effect.
 *
 * The application must supply the file \ref conf_sleepmgr.h.
 *
 * For the sleep manager to be enabled, the symbol \ref CONFIG_SLEEPMGR_ENABLE
 * must be defined, e.g., in \ref conf_sleepmgr.h. If this symbol is not
 * defined, the functions are replaced with dummy functions and no RAM is used.
