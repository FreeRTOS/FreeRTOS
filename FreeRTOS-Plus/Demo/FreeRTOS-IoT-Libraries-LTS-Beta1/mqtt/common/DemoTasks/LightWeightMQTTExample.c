/*
 * Demo for showing use of the MQTT light weight serializer API.
 * The Light weight serializer API lets user to serialize and
 * deserialize MQTT messages into a user provided buffer.
 * This API allows use of a statically allocated buffer.
 *
 * The Example shown below uses this API to create MQTT messages and
 * send them over the connection established using FreeRTOS sockets.
 * The example is single threaded and uses statically allocated memory;
 * it uses QOS0 and therefore does not implement any retransmission
 * mechanism for Publish messages.
 *
 * !!! NOTE !!!
 * This is work in progress to show how the light weight serializer
 * API can be used. This is not a complete demo, and should not
 * be treated as production ready code.
