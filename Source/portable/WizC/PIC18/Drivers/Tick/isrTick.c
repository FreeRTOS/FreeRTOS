/* 
Changes from V3.0.0
	+ ISRcode pulled inline to reduce stack-usage.

	+ Added functionality to only call vTaskSwitchContext() once
	  when handling multiple interruptsources in a single interruptcall.

	+ Filename changed to a .c extension to allow stepping through code
	  using F7.

Changes from V3.0.1
