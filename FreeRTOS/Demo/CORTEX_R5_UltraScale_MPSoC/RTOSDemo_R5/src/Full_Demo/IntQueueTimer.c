/*
 * This file initialises three timers as follows:
 *
 * Timer 0 and Timer 1 provide the interrupts that are used with the IntQ
 * standard demo tasks, which test interrupt nesting and using queues from
 * interrupts.  Both these interrupts operate below the maximum syscall
 * interrupt priority.
 *
 * Timer 2 is a much higher frequency timer that tests the nesting of interrupts
 * that execute above the maximum syscall interrupt priority.
 *
 * All the timers can nest with the tick interrupt - creating a maximum
 * interrupt nesting depth of 4.
 *
 * For convenience, the high frequency timer is also used to provide the time
 * base for the run time stats.
