 * @details
 *
 * This component contains the implementation of the XUartLite component which is
 * the driver for the Xilinx UART Lite device. This UART is a minimal hardware
 * implementation with minimal features.  Most of the features, including baud
 * rate, parity, and number of data bits are only configurable when the hardware
 * device is built, rather than at run time by software.
 *
 * The device has 16 byte transmit and receive FIFOs and supports interrupts.
 * The device does not have any way to disable the receiver such that the
 * receive FIFO may contain unwanted data.  The FIFOs are not flushed when the
 * driver is initialized, but a function is provided to allow the user to
 * reset the FIFOs if desired.
 *
 * The driver defaults to no interrupts at initialization such that interrupts
 * must be enabled if desired. An interrupt is generated when the transmit FIFO
 * transitions from having data to being empty or when any data is contained in
 * the receive FIFO.
 *
 * In order to use interrupts, it's necessary for the user to connect the driver
 * interrupt handler, XUartLite_InterruptHandler, to the interrupt system of the
 * application.  This function does not save and restore the processor context
 * such that the user must provide it.  Send and receive handlers may be set for
 * the driver such that the handlers are called when transmit and receive
 * interrupts occur.  The handlers are called from interrupt context and are
 * designed to allow application specific processing to be performed.
 *
 * The functions, XUartLite_Send and XUartLite_Recv, are provided in the driver
 * to allow data to be sent and received. They are designed to be used in
 * polled or interrupt modes.
 *
 * The driver provides a status for each received byte indicating any parity
 * frame or overrun error. The driver provides statistics which allow visibility
 * into these errors.
 *
 * <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
 *
 * The XUartLite_Config structure is used by the driver to configure itself. This
 * configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based on HW
 * build properties.
 *
 * To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed
 * by various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized in one
 * of the following ways:
 *
 *   - XUartLite_Initialize(InstancePtr, DeviceId) - The driver looks up its own
 *     configuration structure created by the tool-chain based on an ID provided
 *     by the tool-chain.
 *
 *   - XUartLite_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, EffectiveAddr) - Uses a
 *     configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a system
 *     with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address
 *     replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.
 *
 * <b>RTOS Independence</b>
 *
 * This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent.  It works
 * with physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management,
 * threads or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must
 * be satisfied by the layer above this driver.
 *
 * @note
 *
 * The driver is partitioned such that a minimal implementation may be used.
 * More features require additional files to be linked in.

 * <pre>
 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
 * 1.00a ecm  08/31/01 First release
 * 1.00b jhl  02/21/02 Repartitioned the driver for smaller files
 * 1.01a jvb  12/14/05 I separated dependency on the static config table and
 *                     xparameters.h from the driver initialization by moving
 *                     _Initialize and _LookupConfig to _sinit.c. I also added
 *                     the new _CfgInitialize routine.
 * 1.02a rpm  02/14/07 Added check for outstanding transmission before
 *                     calling the send callback (avoids extraneous
 *                     callback invocations) in interrupt service routine.
 * 1.12a mta  03/31/07 Updated to new coding conventions
 * 1.13a sv   01/21/08 Updated driver to support access through DCR bus
 * 1.14a sdm  08/22/08 Removed support for static interrupt handlers from the MDD
 *		      file
 * 1.14a sdm  09/26/08 Updated code to avoid race condition in
 *		      XUartLite_SendBuffer
 * 2.00a ktn  10/20/09 Updated to use HAL Processor APIs. The macros have been
 *		      renamed to remove _m from the name. XUartLite_mClearStats
 *		      macro is removed and XUartLite_ClearStats function should
 *		      be used in its place.
 * 2.01a adk  18/04/13 Updated the code to avoid unused variable
 *		      warnings when compiling with the -Wextra -Wall flags
 *		      In the file xuartlite.c. CR:704999.
 *		      Added notes for CR 710483 that the XUL_FIFO_SIZE is not
 *		      used in the driver. This is the size of the FIFO for
 *		      Transmit/Receive FIFOs which cannot be changed.
 * 3.0 adk 17/12/13  Fixed CR:741186,761863 Changes are made in the file
 *		      xuartlite_selftest.c
 * 3.0 adk 19/12/13  Update the driver as per new TCL API's
 * 3.1 nsk 21/07/15  Updated XUartLite_ReceiveBuffer function in xuartlite.c
 *		    to update the receive data into user buffer in critical
 *		    region.CR#865787.
 * 3.2   sk   11/10/15 Used UINTPTR instead of u32 for Baseaddress CR# 867425.
 *                     Changed the prototype of XUartLite_CfgInitialize API.
