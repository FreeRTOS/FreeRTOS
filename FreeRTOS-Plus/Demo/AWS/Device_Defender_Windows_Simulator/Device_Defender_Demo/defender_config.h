 * AWS IoT Device Defender Service supports both long and short names for keys
 * in the report sent by a device. For example,
 *
 * A device defender report using long key names:
 * {
 *     "header": {
 *         "report_id": 1530304554,
 *         "version": "1.0"
 *     },
 *     "metrics": {
 *         "network_stats": {
 *             "bytes_in": 29358693495,
 *             "bytes_out": 26485035,
 *             "packets_in": 10013573555,
 *             "packets_out": 11382615
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * An equivalent report using short key names:
 * {
 *     "hed": {
 *         "rid": 1530304554,
 *         "v": "1.0"
 *     },
 *     "met": {
 *         "ns": {
 *             "bi": 29358693495,
 *             "bo": 26485035,
 *             "pi": 10013573555,
 *             "po": 11382615
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Set to 1 to enable use of long key names in the defender report.
