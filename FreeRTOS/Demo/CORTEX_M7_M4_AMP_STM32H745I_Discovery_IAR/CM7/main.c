/*
 * See https://www.freertos.org/STM32H7_Dual_Core_AMP_RTOS_demo.html for usage

 * https://www.freertos.org/articles/001_simple_freertos_core_to_core_communication/simple_freertos_core_to_core_communication_AMP.html
 *
 * Behavior
 * --------
 *
 * This example stress tests a simple Asymmetric Multi Processing (AMP) core to
 * core communication mechanism implemented using FreeRTOS message buffers:
 * https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-stream-message-buffers.html  Message buffers
 * are used to pass an ASCII representation of an incrementing number (so "0",
 * followed by "1", followed by "2", etc.) from a single 'sending' task that
 * runs on the Arm Cortex-M7 core (the M7 core) to two "receiving" tasks
 * running on the Arm Cortex-M4 core (the M4 core).  There are two data message
 * buffers, one for each receiving task.  To distinguish between the receiving
 * tasks one is assigned the task number 0, and the other task number 1.
 *
 * The M7 task sits in a loop sending the ascii strings to each M4 task.  If a
 * receiving task receives the next expected value in the sequence it prints its
 * task number to the UART.  If a receiving task receives anything else, or its
 * attempt to receive data times out, then it hits an assert() that prints an
 * error message to the UART before stopping all further processing on the M4
 * core.  If the example is running correctly you will see lots of "0"s (from
 * the receiving task assigned task number 0) and "1"s (from the receiving task
 * assigned task number 1) streaming from the UART.  The time taken to output
 * characters from the UART is the only thing throttling the speed of the core
 * to core communication as it causes the message buffers to become full - which
 * would probably happen anyway as the M7 core is executing at twice the
 * frequency of the M4 core.
 *
 *
 * Implementation of sbSEND_COMPLETED()
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 * sbSEND_COMPLETED is a macro called by FreeRTOS after data has been sent to a
 * message buffer in case there was a task blocked on the message buffer waiting
 * for data to become available - in which case the waiting task would be
 * unblocked:  https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-message-buffer-example.html
 * However, the default sbSEND_COMPLETED implementation assumes the sending task
 * (or interrupt) and the receiving task are under the control of the same
 * instance of the FreeRTOS kernel and run on the same MCU core.  In this AMP
 * example the sending task and the receiving tasks are under the control of two
 * different instances of the FreeRTOS kernel, and run on different MCU cores,
 * so the default sbSEND_COMPLETED implementation won't work (each FreeRTOS
 * kernel instance only knowns about the tasks under its control).  AMP
 * scenarios therefore require the sbSEND_COMPLETED macro (and potentially the
 * sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED macro, see below) to be overridden, which is done by
 * simply providing your own implementation in the project's FreeRTOSConfig.h
 * file.  Note this example has a FreeRTOSConfig.h file used by the application
 * that runs on the M7 core and a separate FreeRTOSConfig.h file used by the
 * application that runs on the M4 core.  The implementation of sbSEND_COMPLETED
 * used by the M7 core simply triggers an interrupt in the M4 core.  The
 * interrupt's handler (the ISR that was triggered by the M7 core but executes
 * on the M4 core) must then do the job that would otherwise be done by the
 * default implementation of sbSEND_COMPLETE - namely unblock a task if the task
 * was waiting to receive data from the message buffer that now contains data.
 * There are two data message buffers though, so first ISR must determine which
 * of the two contains data.
 *
 * This demo only has two data message buffers, so it would be reasonable to
 * have the ISR simply query both to see which contained data, but that solution
 * would not scale if there are many message buffers, or if the number of
 * message buffers was unknown.  Therefore, to demonstrate a more scalable
 * solution, this example introduced a third message buffer - a 'control'
 * message buffer as opposed to a 'data' message buffer.  After the task on the
 * M7 core writes to a data message buffer it writes the handle of the message
 * buffer that contains data to the control message buffer.  The ISR running on
 * the M4 core then reads from the control message buffer to know which data
 * message buffer contains data.
 *
 * The above described scenario contains many implementation decisions.
 * Alternative methods of enabling the M4 core to know data message buffer
 * contains data include:
 *
 *  1) Using a different interrupt for each data message buffer.
 *  2) Passing all data from the M7 core to the M4 core through a single message
 *     buffer, along with additional data that tells the ISR running on the M4
 *     core which task to forward the data to.
 *
 *
 * Implementation of sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED()
 * ---------------------------------------
 *
 * sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED is the complement of sbSEND_COMPLETED.  It is a macro
 * called by FreeRTOS after data has been read from a message buffer in case
 * there was a task blocked on the message buffer waiting for space to become
 * available - in which case the waiting task would be unblocked so it can
 * complete its write to the buffer.
 *
 * In this example the M7 task writes to the message buffers faster than the M4
 * tasks read from them (in part because the M7 is running faster, and in part
 * because the M4 cores write to the UART), so the buffers become full, and the
 * M7 task enters the Blocked state to wait for space to become available.  As
 * with the sbSEND_COMPLETED macro, the default implementation of the
 * sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED macro only works if the sender and receiver are under the
 * control of the same instance of FreeRTOS and execute on the same core.
 * Therefore, just as the application that executes on the M7 core overrides
 * the default implementation of sbSEND_SOMPLETED(), the application that runs
 * on the M4 core overrides the default implementation of sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED()
 * to likewise generate an interrupt in the M7 core - so sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED()
 * executes on the M4 core and generates an interrupt on the M7 core.  To keep
 * things simple the ISR that runs on the M7 core does not use a control
 * message buffer to know which data message buffer contains space, and instead
 * simply sends a notification to both data message buffers.  Note however that
 * this overly simplistic implementation is only acceptable because it is
 * known that there is only one sending task, and that task cannot be blocked on
 * both message buffers at the same time.  Also, sending the notification to the
 * data message buffer updates the receiving task's direct to task notification
 * state: https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html which is only ok
 * because it is known the task is not using its notification state for any
 * other purpose.
