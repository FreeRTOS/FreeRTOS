 *
 *  @brief      Watchdog driver implementation for CC32XX
 *
 *  The Watchdog header file for CC32XX should be included in an application
 *  as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/Watchdog.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/watchdog/WatchdogCC32XX.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref Watchdog.h for a complete description of APIs.
 *
 *  This Watchdog driver implementation is designed to operate on a CC32XX
 *  device. Once opened, CC32XX Watchdog will count down from the reload
 *  value specified in the WatchdogCC32XX_HWAttrs. If it times out, the
 *  Watchdog interrupt flag will be set, and a user-provided callback function
 *  will be called. If the Watchdog Timer is allowed to time out again while
 *  the interrupt flag is still pending, a reset signal will be generated.
 *  To prevent a reset, Watchdog_clear() must be called to clear the interrupt
 *  flag.
 *
 *  The reload value from which the Watchdog Timer counts down may be changed
 *  during runtime using Watchdog_setReload().
 *
 *  Watchdog_close() is <b>not</b> supported by this driver implementation.
 *
 *  By default the Watchdog driver has resets turned on and this feature cannot
 *  be turned disabled.
 *
 *  To have a user-defined function run at the warning interrupt, first define
 *  a void-type function that takes a Watchdog_Handle cast to a UArg as an
 *  argument. The callback and code to start the Watchdog timer are shown below.
 *
 *  @code
 *  void watchdogCallback(UArg handle);
 *
 *  ...
 *
 *  Watchdog_Handle handle;
 *  Watchdog_Params params;
 *  uint32_t tickValue;
 *
 *  Watchdog_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.callbackFxn = watchdogCallback;
 *  handle = Watchdog_open(Watchdog_configIndex, &params);
 *  // Set timeout period to 100 ms
 *  tickValue = Watchdog_convertMsToTicks(handle, 100);
 *  Watchdog_setReload(handle, tickValue);
 *
 *  ...
 *
 *  void watchdogCallback(UArg handle)
 *  {
 *      // User-defined code here
 *      ...
 *
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *  ============================================================================

 *  for usage.  For example, for SYS/BIOS applications, refer to the

 *  instead of making OS calls directly, then the HwiP port handles the
 *  interrupt priority in an OS specific way.  In the case of the SYS/BIOS
 *  port, intPriority is passed unmodified to Hwi_create().
