/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.
 *
 * Main. c also creates a task called "Print".  This only executes every five 
 * seconds but has the highest priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.  
 * Its main function is to check that all the other tasks are still operational.  
 * Nearly all the tasks in the demo application maintain a unique count that is 
 * incremented each time the task successfully completes its function.  Should any 
 * error occur within the task the count is permanently halted.  The print task 
 * checks the count of each task to ensure it has changed since the last time the 
 * print task executed.  If any count is found not to have changed the print task
 * displays an appropriate message, halts, and flashes the on board LED rapidly.
 * If all the tasks are still incrementing their unique counts the print task
 * displays an "OK" message.
 *
 * The LED flash tasks do not maintain a count as they already provide visual
 * feedback of their status.
 *
 * The print task blocks on the queue into which messages that require displaying
 * are posted.  It will therefore only block for the full 5 seconds if no messages
 * are posted onto the queue.
 *
 * Main. c also provides a demonstration of how the trace visualisation utility can
 * be used, and how the scheduler can be stopped.
 *
 * On the Flashlite it is preferable not to try to write to the console during
 * real time operation.  The built in LED is toggled every cycle of the print task
 * that does not encounter any errors, so the console IO may be removed if required.
 * The build in LED will start flashing rapidly if any task reports an error.

/*
Changes from V1.01:

	+ Previously, if an error occurred in a task the on board LED was stopped from
	  toggling.  Now if an error occurs the check task enters an infinite loop,
	  toggling the LED rapidly.

Changes from V1.2.3

	+ The integer and comtest tasks are now used when the cooperative scheduler 
	  is being used.  Previously they were only used with the preemptive
	  scheduler.

Changes from V1.2.5

	+ Made the communications RX task a higher priority.

Changes from V2.0.0

	+ Delay periods are now specified using variables and constants of
	  TickType_t rather than unsigned long.
