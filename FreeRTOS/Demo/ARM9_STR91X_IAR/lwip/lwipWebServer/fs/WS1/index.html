				FreeRTOS.org<SMALL><SUP>TM</SUP></SMALL> is a portable, open source, <i>mini</i> Real Time Kernel - a free to download and royalty free RTOS 
				that <a href="http://www.freertos.org/a00114.html#gpl">can be used in commercial applications</a>. 
		<p>
				Ports exist for many different processor architectures and development tools.  Each official port includes a pre-configured
				example application demonstrating the kernel features, expediting learning, and permitting 'out of the box' development.<p>

				<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=382005" target="_blank">Free support</a> is provided by an active user community.  
				<a href="http://www.highintegritysystems.com/openrtos.html" target="_blank">Commercial support</a> along with a 
				<a href="http://www.freertos.org/a00115.html">full development service</a> is also provided.<p>

				<a href="http://www.safertos.com/" target="_blank">SafeRTOS</a><small><sup>TM</sup></small> is a version that has been certified for use
				in safety critical applications. It is a functionally similar product for which complete 
				<a href="http://www.iec.ch/zone/fsafety/fsafety_entry.htm" target="_blank">IEC 61508</a> compliant development/safety lifecyle documentation is available
				(conformance certified by TÜV SÜD, including compiler verification evidence). 
				While FreeRTOS.org does not contain the same safety features as SafeRTOS there is still commonality - allowing FreeRTOS.org to benefit directly from the 
				very rigorous SafeRTOS testing and validation activities.
