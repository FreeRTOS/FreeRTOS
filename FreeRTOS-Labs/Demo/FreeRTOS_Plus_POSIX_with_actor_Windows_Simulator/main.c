 ******************************************************************************
 * -NOTE- The Win32 port is a simulation (or is that emulation?) only!  Do not
 * expect to get real time behaviour from the Win32 port or this demo
 * application.  It is provided as a convenient development and demonstration
 * test bed only.  This was tested using Windows 10 with Intel Core i7-6700 CPU.
 *
 * Windows will not be running the FreeRTOS simulator threads continuously, so
 * the timing information has no meaningful units. See the documentation page for
 * the Windows simulator for an explanation of the slow timing:
 * http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Windows-Simulator-Emulator-for-Visual-Studio-and-Eclipse-MingW.html
 * - READ THE WEB DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS PORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ON USING IT -
