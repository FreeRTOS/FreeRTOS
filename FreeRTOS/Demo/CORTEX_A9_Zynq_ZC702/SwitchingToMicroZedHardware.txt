The Zynq project is provided pre-configured to run on the ZC702 hardware.  This
file describes how to run the project on the MicroZed.

1) Import the projects as described on the documentation page linked to by
the Instructions_Readme file, but importing all four projects rather than the
three described in the instructions.  The forth project is MicroZed_hw_platform.

2) Select "File->New-Board Support Package" XSDK (Eclipse) IDE's File menu.  In
the pop up window, call the BSP project MicroZed_bsp, save the bsp in a convenient
location, IMPORTANTLY ensure MicroZed_hw_platform is selected as the hardware
platform and standalone is selected as the bsp type.  Then click Finish to close
the pop up window.  The board support package settings window can then also be
closed without any changes from the default values.

3) Right click the RTOSDemo project in the XSDK's project explorer window and
select "Change referenced BSP" from the pop up window.  Select MicroZed_bsp as
the referenced BSP.

4) Change the definition of partstLED_OUTPUT from 10 to 47 in
RTOSDemo/src/ParTest.c - that changes the output used to toggle the LED to be
correct for the MicroZed hardware.

5) Select Clean and then from the XSDK's project menu.

6) Right click the RTOSDemo project again, and select Refresh from the pop up
menu, before finally right clicking the project one final time and clicking
Build.

7) Select MicroZed_hw_platform as the hardware platform in the "Target Setup"
tab of the debug configuration.
