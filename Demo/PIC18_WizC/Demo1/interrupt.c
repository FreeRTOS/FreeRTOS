Changes from V3.0.0

** You cannot use local variables. Alternatives are:
** - Use static variables	(Global RAM usage increases)
** - Call a function		(Additional cycles are needed)
** - Use unused SFR's		(preferred, no additional overhead)
** See "../Serial/isrSerialTx.c" for an example of this last option
