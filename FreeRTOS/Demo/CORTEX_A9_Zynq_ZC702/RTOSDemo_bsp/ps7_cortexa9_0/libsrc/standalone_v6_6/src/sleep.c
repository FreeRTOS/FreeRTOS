 * ----- -------- -------- -----------------------------------------------
 * 1.00a ecm/sdm  11/11/09 First release
 * 3.07a sgd      07/05/12 Updated sleep function to make use Global
 * 6.0   asa      08/15/16 Updated the sleep signature. Fix for CR#956899.
 * 6.6	srm      10/18/17 Updated sleep routines to support user configurable
