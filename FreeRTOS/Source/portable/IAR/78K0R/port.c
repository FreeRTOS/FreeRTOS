a frame pointer this cannot be done as modifying the stack will clobber all
the stack variables.  Instead each task maintains a count of the critical
section nesting depth.  Each time a critical section is entered the count is
incremented.  Each time a critical section is left the count is decremented -
with interrupts only being re-enabled if the count is zero.
