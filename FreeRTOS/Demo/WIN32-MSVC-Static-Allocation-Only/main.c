/******************************************************************************
 *
 * This project is provided as an example of how to create a FreeRTOS project
 * that does not need a heap.  configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION is set to 1 to
 * allow RTOS objects to be created using statically allocated RAM, and
 * configSUPPORT_DYNAMIC_ALLOCATION is set to 0 to remove any build dependency
 * on the FreeRTOS heap.  When configSUPPORT_DYNAMIC_ALLOCATION is set to 0
 * pvPortMalloc() just equates to NULL, and calls to vPortFree() have no
 * effect.  See:
 *
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html and
 * http://www.freertos.org/Static_Vs_Dynamic_Memory_Allocation.html
