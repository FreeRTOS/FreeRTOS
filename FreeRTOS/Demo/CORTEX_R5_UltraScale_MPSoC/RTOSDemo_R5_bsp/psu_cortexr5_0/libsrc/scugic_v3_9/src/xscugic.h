 * @details
 *
 * The generic interrupt controller driver component.
 *
 * The interrupt controller driver uses the idea of priority for the various
 * handlers. Priority is an integer within the range of 1 and 31 inclusive with
 * default of 1 being the highest priority interrupt source. The priorities
 * of the various sources can be dynamically altered as needed through
 * hardware configuration.
 *
 * The generic interrupt controller supports the following
 * features:
 *
 *   - specific individual interrupt enabling/disabling
 *   - specific individual interrupt acknowledging
 *   - attaching specific callback function to handle interrupt source
 *   - assigning desired priority to interrupt source if default is not
 *     acceptable.
 *
 * Details about connecting the interrupt handler of the driver are contained
 * in the source file specific to interrupt processing, xscugic_intr.c.
 *
 * This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent.  It works with
 * physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads
 * or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be
 * satisfied by the layer above this driver.
 *
 * <b>Interrupt Vector Tables</b>
 *
 * The device ID of the interrupt controller device is used by the driver as a
 * direct index into the configuration data table. The user should populate the
 * vector table with handlers and callbacks at run-time using the
 * XScuGic_Connect() and XScuGic_Disconnect() functions.
 *
 * Each vector table entry corresponds to a device that can generate an
 * interrupt. Each entry contains an interrupt handler function and an
 * argument to be passed to the handler when an interrupt occurs.  The
 * user must use XScuGic_Connect() when the interrupt handler takes an
 * argument other than the base address.
 *
 * <b>Nested Interrupts Processing</b>
 *
 * Nested interrupts are not supported by this driver.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * The generic interrupt controller is not a part of the snoop control unit
 * as indicated by the prefix "scu" in the name of the driver.
 * It is an independent module in APU.
 *
 * <pre>
 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- ---------------------------------------------------------
 * 1.00a drg  01/19/00 First release
 * 1.01a sdm  11/09/11 The XScuGic and XScuGic_Config structures have changed.
 *		      The HandlerTable (of type XScuGic_VectorTableEntry) is
 *		      moved to XScuGic_Config structure from XScuGic structure.
 *
 *		      The "Config" entry in XScuGic structure is made as
 *		      pointer for better efficiency.
 *
 *		      A new file named as xscugic_hw.c is now added. It is
 *		      to implement low level driver routines without using
 *		      any xscugic instance pointer. They are useful when the
 *		      user wants to use xscugic through device id or
 *		      base address. The driver routines provided are explained
 *		      below.
 *		      XScuGic_DeviceInitialize that takes device id as
 *		      argument and initializes the device (without calling
 *		      XScuGic_CfgInitialize).
 *		      XScuGic_DeviceInterruptHandler that takes device id
 *		      as argument and calls appropriate handlers from the
 *		      HandlerTable.
 *		      XScuGic_RegisterHandler that registers a new handler
 *		      by taking xscugic hardware base address as argument.
 *		      LookupConfigByBaseAddress is used to return the
 *		      corresponding config structure from XScuGic_ConfigTable
 *		      based on the scugic base address passed.
 * 1.02a sdm  12/20/11 Removed AckBeforeService from the XScuGic_Config
 *		      structure.
 * 1.03a srt  02/27/13 Moved Offset calculation macros from *.c and *_hw.c to
 *		      *_hw.h
 *		      Added APIs
 *			- XScuGic_SetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr()
 *			- XScuGic_GetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr()
 *		      (CR 702687)
 *			Added support to direct interrupts to the appropriate CPU. Earlier
 *			  interrupts were directed to CPU1 (hard coded). Now depending
 *			  upon the CPU selected by the user (xparameters.h), interrupts
 *			  will be directed to the relevant CPU. This fixes CR 699688.
 * 1.04a hk   05/04/13 Assigned EffectiveAddr to CpuBaseAddress in
 *			  XScuGic_CfgInitialize. Fix for CR#704400 to remove warnings.
 *			  Moved functions XScuGic_SetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr and
 *             XScuGic_GetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr to xscugic_hw.c.
 *			  This is fix for CR#705621.
 * 1.05a hk   06/26/13 Modified tcl to export external interrupts correctly to
 *                     xparameters.h. Fix for CR's 690505, 708928 & 719359.
 * 2.0   adk  12/10/13 Updated as per the New Tcl API's
 * 2.1   adk  25/04/14 Fixed the CR:789373 changes are made in the driver tcl file.
 * 3.00  kvn  02/13/15 Modified code for MISRA-C:2012 compliance.
 * 3.2   asa  02/29/16 Modified DistributorInit function for Zynq AMP case. The
 *			  distributor is left uninitialized for Zynq AMP. It is assumed
 *             that the distributor will be initialized by Linux master. However
 *             for CortexR5 case, the earlier code is left unchanged where the
 *             the interrupt processor target registers in the distributor is
 *             initialized with the corresponding CPU ID on which the application
 *             built over the scugic driver runs.
 *             These changes fix CR#937243.
 *
 * 3.4   asa  04/07/16 Created a new static function DoDistributorInit to simplify
 *            the flow and avoid code duplication. Changes are made for
 *            USE_AMP use case for R5. In a scenario (in R5 split mode) when
 *            one R5 is operating with A53 in open amp config and other
 *            R5 running baremetal app, the existing code
 *            had the potential to stop the whole AMP solution to work (if
 *            for some reason the R5 running the baremetal app tasked to
 *            initialize the Distributor hangs or crashes before initializing).
 *            Changes are made so that the R5 under AMP first checks if
 *            the distributor is enabled or not and if not, it does the
 *            standard Distributor initialization.
 *            This fixes the CR#952962.
 * 3.6   ms   01/23/17 Modified xil_printf statement in main function for all
 *                     examples to ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed"
 *                     strings are available in all examples. This is a fix
 *                     for CR-965028.
 *       kvn  02/17/17 Add support for changing GIC CPU master at run time.
 *       kvn  02/28/17 Make the CpuId as static variable and Added new
 *                     XScugiC_GetCpuId to access CpuId.
 *       ms   03/17/17 Added readme.txt file in examples folder for doxygen
 *                     generation.
 * 3.7   ms   04/11/17 Modified tcl file to add suffix U for all macro
 *                     definitions of scugic in xparameters.h
 * 3.8   mus  07/05/17 Updated scugic.tcl to add support for intrrupts connected
 *                     through util_reduced_vector IP(OR gate)
 *       mus  07/05/17 Updated xdefine_zynq_canonical_xpars proc to initialize
 *                     the HandlerTable in XScuGic_ConfigTable to 0, it removes
 *                     the compilation warning in xscugic_g.c. Fix for CR#978736.
 *       mus  07/25/17 Updated xdefine_gic_params proc to export correct canonical
 *                     definitions for pl to ps interrupts.Fix for CR#980534
 * 3.9   mus  02/21/18 Added new API's XScuGic_UnmapAllInterruptsFromCpu and
 *                     XScuGic_InterruptUnmapFromCpu, These API's can be used
 *                     by applications to unmap specific/all interrupts from
 *                     target CPU.
