/// \unit
///
/// !Purpose
///
/// Interface for configuration the Pulse Width Modulation Controller (PWM) peripheral.
///
/// !Usage
///
///    -# Configures PWM clocks A & B to run at the given frequencies using
///       PWMC_ConfigureClocks().
///    -# Configure PWMC channel using PWMC_ConfigureChannel(), PWMC_SetPeriod()
///       and PWMC_SetDutyCycle().
///    -# Enable & disable channel using PWMC_EnableChannel() and 
///       PWMC_DisableChannel().
///    -# Enable & disable the period interrupt for the given PWM channel using 
///       PWMC_EnableChannelIt() and PWMC_DisableChannelIt().
///
/// Please refer to the list of functions in the #Overview# tab of this unit
/// for more detailed information.
