 * to store the whole run since startup.
 *
 * When TRC_CFG_SNAPSHOT_MODE is TRC_SNAPSHOT_MODE_STOP_WHEN_FULL, the
 * recording is stopped when the buffer becomes full. This is useful for
 * recording events following a specific state, e.g., the startup sequence.

 * TRC_CFG_USE_IMPLICIT_IFE_RULES
 *
 * Macro which should be defined as either zero (0) or one (1).
 * Default is 1.
 *
 * Tracealyzer groups the events into "instances" based on Instance Finish
 * Events (IFEs), produced either by default rules or calls to the recorder
 * functions vTraceInstanceFinishedNow and vTraceInstanceFinishedNext.
 *
 * If TRC_CFG_USE_IMPLICIT_IFE_RULES is one (1), the default IFE rules is
 * used, resulting in a "typical" grouping of events into instances.
 * If these rules don't give appropriate instances in your case, you can
 * override the default rules using vTraceInstanceFinishedNow/Next for one
 * or several tasks. The default IFE rules are then disabled for those tasks.
 *
 * If TRC_CFG_USE_IMPLICIT_IFE_RULES is zero (0), the implicit IFE rules are
 * disabled globally. You must then call vTraceInstanceFinishedNow or
 * vTraceInstanceFinishedNext to manually group the events into instances,
 * otherwise the tasks will appear a single long instance.
 *
 * The default IFE rules count the following events as "instance finished":
 * - Task delay, delay until
 * - Task suspend
 * - Blocking on "input" operations, i.e., when the task is waiting for the
 *   next a message/signal/event. But only if this event is blocking.

/******************************************************************************
 * TRC_CFG_USE_16BIT_OBJECT_HANDLES
 *
 * Macro which should be defined as either zero (0) or one (1).
 *
 * If set to 0 (zero), the recorder uses 8-bit handles to identify kernel
 * objects such as tasks and queues. This limits the supported number of
 * concurrently active objects to 255 of each type (tasks, queues, mutexes,
 * etc.) Note: 255, not 256, since handle 0 is reserved.
 *
 * If set to 1 (one), the recorder uses 16-bit handles to identify kernel
 * objects such as tasks and queues. This limits the supported number of
 * concurrent objects to 65535 of each type (object class). However, since the
 * object property table is limited to 64 KB, the practical limit is about
 * 3000 objects in total.
 *
 * Default is 0 (8-bit handles)
 *
 * NOTE: An object with handle above 255 will use an extra 4-byte record in
 * the event buffer whenever the object is referenced. Moreover, some internal
 * tables in the recorder gets slightly larger when using 16-bit handles.

 *
 * If this is one (1), the TRACE_ASSERT macro (used at various locations in the
 * trace recorder) will verify that a relevant condition is true.
 * If the condition is false, prvTraceError() will be called, which stops the
 * recording and stores an error message that is displayed when opening the
 * trace in Tracealyzer.
 *
 * This is used on several places in the recorder code for sanity checks on
 * parameters. Can be switched off to reduce the footprint of the tracing, but

#define TRC_CFG_USE_TRACE_ASSERT 1

/*******************************************************************************
 * TRC_CFG_USE_SEPARATE_USER_EVENT_BUFFER
 *
 * Macro which should be defined as an integer value.
 *
 * Set TRC_CFG_USE_SEPARATE_USER_EVENT_BUFFER to 1 to enable the
 * separate user event buffer (UB).
 * In this mode, user events are stored separately from other events,
 * e.g., RTOS events. Thereby you can get a much longer history of
 * user events as they don't need to share the buffer space with more
 * frequent events.
 *
 * The UB is typically used with the snapshot ring-buffer mode, so the
 * recording can continue when the main buffer gets full. And since the
 * main buffer then overwrites the earliest events, Tracealyzer displays
 * "Unknown Actor" instead of task scheduling for periods with UB data only.
 *
 * In UB mode, user events are structured as UB channels, which contains
 * a channel name and a default format string. Register a UB channel using
 * xTraceRegisterUBChannel.
 *
 * Events and data arguments are written using vTraceUBEvent and
 * vTraceUBData. They are designed to provide efficient logging of
 * repeating events, using the same format string within each channel.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *  traceString chn1 = xTraceRegisterString("Channel 1");
 *  traceString fmt1 = xTraceRegisterString("Event!");
 *  traceUBChannel UBCh1 = xTraceRegisterUBChannel(chn1, fmt1);
 *
 *  traceString chn2 = xTraceRegisterString("Channel 2");
 *  traceString fmt2 = xTraceRegisterString("X: %d, Y: %d");
 *	traceUBChannel UBCh2 = xTraceRegisterUBChannel(chn2, fmt2);
 *
 *  // Result in "[Channel 1] Event!"
 *	vTraceUBEvent(UBCh1);
 *
 *  // Result in "[Channel 2] X: 23, Y: 19"
 *	vTraceUBData(UBCh2, 23, 19);
 *
 * You can also use the other user event functions, like vTracePrintF.
 * as they are then rerouted to the UB instead of the main event buffer.
 * vTracePrintF then looks up the correct UB channel based on the
 * provided channel name and format string, or creates a new UB channel
 * if no match is found. The format string should therefore not contain
 * "random" messages but mainly format specifiers. Random strings should
 * be stored using %s and with the string as an argument.
 *
 *  // Creates a new UB channel ("Channel 2", "%Z: %d")
 *  vTracePrintF(chn2, "%Z: %d", value1);
 *
 *  // Finds the existing UB channel
 *  vTracePrintF(chn2, "%Z: %d", value2);

 * If tracing multiple ISRs, this setting allows for accurate display of the

 *
 * vTraceStoreISREnd normally assumes that the ISR returns to the previous
