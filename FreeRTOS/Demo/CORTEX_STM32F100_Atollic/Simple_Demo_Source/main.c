/*
This simple demo project runs on the STM32 Discovery board, which is
populated with an STM32F100RB Cortex-M3 microcontroller.  The discovery board
makes an ideal low cost evaluation platform, but the 8K of RAM provided on the
STM32F100RB does not allow the simple application to demonstrate all of all the
FreeRTOS kernel features.  Therefore, this simple demo only actively
demonstrates task, queue, timer and interrupt functionality.  In addition, the
demo is configured to include malloc failure, idle and stack overflow hook
functions.

The idle hook function:
The idle hook function queries the amount of FreeRTOS heap space that is
remaining (see vApplicationIdleHook() defined in this file).  The demo
application is configured to use 7K of the available 8K of RAM as the FreeRTOS
heap.  Memory is only allocated from this heap during initialisation, and this
demo only actually uses 1.6K bytes of the configured 7K available - leaving 5.4K
bytes of heap space unallocated.

The main() Function:
main() creates one software timer, one queue, and two tasks.  It then starts the
scheduler.

The Queue Send Task:
The queue send task is implemented by the prvQueueSendTask() function in this
file.  prvQueueSendTask() sits in a loop that causes it to repeatedly block for
200 milliseconds, before sending the value 100 to the queue that was created
within main().  Once the value is sent, the task loops back around to block for
another 200 milliseconds.

The Queue Receive Task:
The queue receive task is implemented by the prvQueueReceiveTask() function
in this file.  prvQueueReceiveTask() sits in a loop where it repeatedly blocks
on attempts to read data from the queue that was created within main().  When
data is received, the task checks the value of the data, and if the value equals
the expected 100, toggles the green LED.  The 'block time' parameter passed to
the queue receive function specifies that the task should be held in the Blocked
state indefinitely to wait for data to be available on the queue.  The queue
receive task will only leave the Blocked state when the queue send task writes
to the queue.  As the queue send task writes to the queue every 200
milliseconds, the queue receive task leaves the Blocked state every 200
milliseconds, and therefore toggles the green LED every 200 milliseconds.

The LED Software Timer and the Button Interrupt:
The user button B1 is configured to generate an interrupt each time it is
pressed.  The interrupt service routine switches the red LED on, and resets the
LED software timer.  The LED timer has a 5000 millisecond (5 second) period, and
uses a callback function that is defined to just turn the red LED off.
Therefore, pressing the user button will turn the red LED on, and the LED will
remain on until a full five seconds pass without the button being pressed.
