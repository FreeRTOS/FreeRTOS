Install instructions for ACPI CA BlackBox Utility on Windows XP.

- Copy everything into a target directory

- Run the ACPI BlackBox Utility (abbu.exe)

- Select Options | Dump DSDT AML to get the current DSDT.AML file

- Use AcpiDump to convert the AML file to a readable format (acpidump DSDT.AML)
  The default output name is "dsdt.dsl".  

- Create a file extra.asl with the following:

DefinitionBlock("extra.aml", "DSDT", 0x1, "INTEL", "ABCDE", 0x1)
{
    Scope(\_SB)
    {
        Device(ABBU)
        {
            Name(_HID, "ACPIABB0")
            Method(ENBL)
            {
                Return(Zero)
            }

            Method(TEST)
            {
                Return(Zero)
            }

	    // List all test names here, separated by commas
	    // It provides a convenient list of tests available on the platform
	    Name(TSTS, Package()
	    {
		"ENBL",
		"TEST"
	    })
        }
    }
}

NOTE: The closing bracket of the DefinitionBlock MUST come after the closing bracket of this SB scope.
      Also, this is a minimum injected code sample.  Added Methods to test specific DSDT functions found
      in the DSDT.ASL file created earlier.

- Use iasl.exe to compile EXTRA.ASL to create EXTRA.AML.  Use the -i switch to ignore errors

- Run abbu.exe and press the 'Modify DSDT...' button

- Point the Original DSDT path to DSDT.AML - It should be pointing to the file already

- Point the Injected code path to EXTRA.AML - It should be pointing to the file already

- Reboot

- Windows XP should find your new device and want to load a driver.
  Point it to the directory into which you copied the abbu.sys and abbu.inf files

- Using the abbu.exe in the target directory:
  - Use the 'Connect Driver' button to connect to the driver
  - Use the 'Execute Ctrl Method' button to open a dialog box and enter a Method name (i.e. TEST)
  - The driver will return a DWORD only with the results in the output box.

Use Method(TEST) as a template to create new methods.

TO UNINSTALL:
=============
- Use Device Manager to uninstall the 'Intel ACPI Black Box Utility Control Device' under 'System Devices'
