 * Demo for showing use of the MQTT API using a mutually authenticated
 * network connection.
 *
 * The Example shown below uses MQTT APIs to create MQTT messages and send them
 * over the mutually authenticated network connection established with the
 * MQTT broker. This example is single threaded and uses statically allocated
 * memory. It uses QoS1 for sending to and receiving messages from the broker.
 *
 * A mutually authenticated TLS connection is used to connect to the
 * MQTT message broker in this example. Define democonfigMQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT,
 * democonfigROOT_CA_PEM, democonfigCLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PEM,
 * and democonfigCLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM in demo_config.h to establish a
 * mutually authenticated connection.
