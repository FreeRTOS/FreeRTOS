/*
 * This file initialises three timers as follows:
 *
 * TC0 channels 0 and 1 provide the interrupts that are used with the IntQ
 * standard demo tasks, which test interrupt nesting and using queues from
 * interrupts.  As the interrupt is shared the nesting achieved is not as deep
 * as normal when this test is executed, but still worth while.
 *
 * TC2 channel 0 provides a much higher frequency timer that tests the nesting
 * of interrupts that don't use the FreeRTOS API.  For convenience, the high
 * frequency timer also keeps a count of the number of time it executes, and the
 * count is used as the time base for the run time stats (which can be viewed
 * through the CLI).
 *
 * All the timers can nest with the tick interrupt - creating a maximum
 * interrupt nesting depth of 3 (normally 4, if the first two timers used
 * separate interrupts).
