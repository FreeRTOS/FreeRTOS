/*
 * Normally the interrupt nesting test would use [at least] two separate timers.
 * In this case, there was difficulty generating interrupts from TC1, so only
 * TC0 is used.  Nested interrupts are instead generated by manually pending the
 * TC1 interrupt from inside the TC0 interrupt handler.  This means TC1 must be
 * assigned an interrupt priority above TC0.  [Note this arrangement does not
 * really fulfil the purpose of the test as the nesting always occurs at the
 * same point in the code, whereas the test is designed to test nesting
 * occurring within the queue API functions]
