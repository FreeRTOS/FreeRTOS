/*
 * Creates a task and a timer that operate on an interrupt driven serial port.
 * This demo assumes that the characters transmitted on a port will also be
 * received on the same port.  Therefore, the UART must either be connected to
 * an echo server, or the uart connector must have a loopback connector fitted.
 * See http://www.serialporttool.com/CommEcho.htm for a suitable echo server
 * for Windows hosts.
 *
 * The timer sends a string to the UART, toggles an LED, then resets itself by
 * changing its own period.  The period is calculated as a pseudo random number
 * between comTX_MAX_BLOCK_TIME and comTX_MIN_BLOCK_TIME.
 *
 * The task blocks on an Rx queue waiting for a character to become available.
 * Received characters are checked to ensure they match those transmitted by the
 * Tx timer.  An error is latched if characters are missing, incorrect, or
 * arrive too slowly.
 *
 * How characters are actually transmitted and received is port specific.  Demos
 * that include this test/demo file will provide example drivers.  The Tx timer
 * executes in the context of the timer service (daemon) task, and must
 * therefore never attempt to block.
 *
