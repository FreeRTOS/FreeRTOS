 * This demo is configured to execute on the ES449 prototyping board from
 * SoftBaugh. The ES449 has a built in LCD display and a single built in user
 * LED.  Therefore, in place of flashing an LED, the 'flash' and 'check' tasks
 * toggle '*' characters on the LCD.  The left most '*' represents LED 0, the
 * next LED 1, etc.
 *
 * There is a single genuine on board LED referenced as LED 10.
