Changes from V1.00:

	+ pxPortInitialiseStack() now initialises the stack of new tasks to the
	  same format used by the compiler.  This allows the compiler generated
	  interrupt mechanism to be used for context switches.

Changes from V2.6.1

	+ Move usPortCheckFreeStackSpace() to tasks.c.
