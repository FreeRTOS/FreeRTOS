/*
 * Demo for showing the use of the HTTP API using a server-authenticated network
 * connection.
 *
 * This example resolves a S3 domain (using a pre-signed URL), establishes a TCP
 * connection, validates the server's certificate using the configurable root CA
 * certificate, and then finally performs a TLS handshake with the HTTP server,
 * so that all communication is encrypted.
 *
 * Afterwards, two additional tasks are created (a request and response task),
 * along with two thread-safe queues (a request and response queue), to
 * demonstrate an asynchronous workflow for downloading an S3 file.
 *
 * There are three tasks to note in this demo:
 * - prvHTTPDemoTask() is responsible for sending HTTP requests to the server
 *   over the transport interface, using the HTTP Client library API. It reads
 *   requests from the request queue and places corresponding server responses
 *   on the response queue.
 * - prvRequestTask() is responsible for generating request objects and adding
 *   them to the request queue, specifying a byte range with each iteration in
 *   order to download the S3 file in partial content responses.
 * - prvResponseTask() logs and evaluates server responses to outgoing requests.
 *   It reads responses from the response queue until the expected number of
 *   responses have been received.
 *
 * Each individual task runs continuously in a loop, until its respective job is
 * completed. If any request fails, an error code is returned.
 *
 * @note This demo requires user-generated pre-signed URLs to be pasted into
 * demo_config.h. Please use the provided script "presigned_urls_gen.py"
 * (located in located in coreHTTP_Windows_Simulator/Common) to generate these
 * URLs. For detailed instructions, see the accompanied README.md.
 *
 * @note If your file requires more than 99 range requests to S3 (depending on the
 * size of the file and the length specified in democonfigRANGE_REQUEST_LENGTH),
 * your connection may be dropped by S3. In this case, either increase the
 * buffer size and range request length (if feasible), to reduce the number of
 * requests required, or re-establish the connection with S3 after receiving a
 * "Connection: close" response header.
