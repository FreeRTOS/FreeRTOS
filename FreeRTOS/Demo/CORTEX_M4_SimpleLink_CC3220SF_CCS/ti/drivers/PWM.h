 *  @brief      PWM driver interface
 *
 *  To use the PWM driver, ensure that the correct driver library for your
 *  device is linked in and include this header file as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/PWM.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  This module serves as the main interface for applications.  Its purpose
 *  is to redirect the PWM APIs to specific driver implementations
 *  which are specified using a pointer to a #PWM_FxnTable.
 *
 *  # Overview #
 *  The PWM driver in TI-RTOS facilitates the generation of Pulse Width
 *  Modulated signals via simple and portable APIs.  PWM instances must be
 *  opened by calling PWM_open() while passing in a PWM index and a parameters
 *  data structure.
 *
 *  The driver APIs serve as an interface to a typical TI-RTOS application.
 *  The specific peripheral implementations are responsible for creating all OS
 *  specific primitives to allow for thread-safe operation.
 *
 *  When a PWM instance is opened, the period, duty cycle and idle level are
 *  configured and the PWM is stopped (waveforms not generated until PWM_start()
 *  is called).  The maximum period and duty supported is device dependent;
 *  refer to the implementation specific documentation for values.
 *
 *  PWM outputs are active-high, meaning the duty will control the duration of
 *  high output on the pin (at 0% duty, the output is always low, at 100% duty,
 *  the output is always high).
 *
 *  # Usage #
 *
 *  @code
 *    PWM_Handle pwm;
 *    PWM_Params pwmParams;
 *
 *    // Initialize the PWM driver.
 *    PWM_init();
 *
 *    // Initialize the PWM parameters
 *    PWM_Params_init(&pwmParams);
 *    pwmParams.idleLevel = PWM_IDLE_LOW;      // Output low when PWM is not running
 *    pwmParams.period.unit = PWM_PERIOD_HZ;   // Period is in Hz
 *    pwmParams.period.value = 1e6;            // 1MHz
 *    pwmParams.duty.unit = PWM_DUTY_FRACTION; // Duty is in fractional percentage
 *    pwmParams.duty.value = 0;                // 0% initial duty cycle
 *
 *    // Open the PWM instance
 *    pwm = PWM_open(Board_PWM0, &pwmParams);
 *
 *    if (pwm == NULL) {
 *        // PWM_open() failed
 *        while (1);
 *    }
 *
 *    PWM_start(handle);                       // start PWM with 0% duty cycle
 *
 *    PWM_setDuty(pwm,
 *         (PWM_DUTY_FRACTION_MAX / 2));       // set duty cycle to 50%
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Details for the example code above are described in the following
 *  subsections.
 *
 *  ### PWM Driver Configuration #
 *
 *  In order to use the PWM APIs, the application is required
 *  to provide device-specific PWM configuration in the Board.c file.
 *  The PWM driver interface defines a configuration data structure:
 *
 *  @code
 *  typedef struct PWM_Config_ {
 *      PWM_FxnTable const    *fxnTablePtr;
 *      void                  *object;
 *      void         const    *hwAttrs;
 *  } PWM_Config;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The application must declare an array of PWM_Config elements, named
 *  PWM_config[].  Each element of PWM_config[] is populated with
 *  pointers to a device specific PWM driver implementation's function
 *  table, driver object, and hardware attributes.  The hardware attributes
 *  define properties such as which pin will be driven, and which timer peripheral
 *  will be used.  Each element in PWM_config[] corresponds to
 *  a PWM instance, and none of the elements should have NULL pointers.
 *
 *  Additionally, the PWM driver interface defines a global integer variable
 *  'PWM_count' which is initialized to the number of PWM instances the
 *  application has defined in the PWM_Config array.
 *
 *  You will need to check the device-specific PWM driver implementation's
 *  header file for example configuration.  Please also refer to the
 *  Board.c file of any of your examples to see the PWM configuration.
 *
 *  ### Initializing the PWM Driver #
 *
 *  PWM_init() must be called before any other PWM APIs.  This function
 *  calls the device implementation's PWM initialization function, for each
 *  element of PWM_config[].
 *
 *  ### Opening the PWM Driver #
 *
 *  Opening a PWM requires four steps:
 *  1.  Create and initialize a PWM_Params structure.
 *  2.  Fill in the desired parameters.
 *  3.  Call PWM_open(), passing the index of the PWM in the PWM_config
 *      structure, and the address of the PWM_Params structure.  The
 *      PWM instance is specified by the index in the PWM_config structure.
 *  4.  Check that the PWM handle returned by PWM_open() is non-NULL,
 *      and save it.  The handle will be used to read and write to the
 *      PWM you just opened.
 *
 *  Only one PWM index can be used at a time; calling PWM_open() a second
 *  time with the same index previously passed to PWM_open() will result in
 *  an error.  You can, though, re-use the index if the instance is closed
 *  via PWM_close().
 *  In the example code, Board_PWM0 is passed to PWM_open().  This macro
 *  is defined in the example's Board.h file.
 *
 *  ### Modes of Operation #
 *
 *  A PWM instance can be configured to interpret the period as one of three
 *  units:
 *      - #PWM_PERIOD_US: The period is in microseconds.
 *      - #PWM_PERIOD_HZ: The period is in (reciprocal) Hertz.
 *      - #PWM_PERIOD_COUNTS: The period is in timer counts.
 *
 *  A PWM instance can be configured to interpret the duty as one of three
 *  units:
 *      - #PWM_DUTY_US: The duty is in microseconds.
 *      - #PWM_DUTY_FRACTION: The duty is in a fractional part of the period
 *                           where 0 is 0% and #PWM_DUTY_FRACTION_MAX is 100%.
 *      - #PWM_DUTY_COUNTS: The period is in timer counts and must be less than
 *                         the period.
 *
 *  The idle level parameter is used to set the output to high/low when the
 *  PWM is not running (stopped or not started).  The idle level can be
 *  set to:
 *      - #PWM_IDLE_LOW
 *      - #PWM_IDLE_HIGH
 *
 *  The default PWM configuration is to set a duty of 0% with a 1MHz frequency.
 *  The default period units are in PWM_PERIOD_HZ and the default duty units
 *  are in PWM_DUTY_FRACTION.  Finally, the default output idle level is
 *  PWM_IDLE_LOW.  It is the application's responsibility to set the duty for
 *  each PWM output used.
 *
 *  ### Controlling the PWM Duty Cycle #
 *
 *  Once the PWM instance has been opened and started, the primary API used
 *  by the application will be #PWM_setDuty() to control the duty cycle of a
 *  PWM pin:
 *
 *  @code
 *     PWM_setDuty(pwm, PWM_DUTY_FRACTION_MAX / 2); // Set 50% duty cycle
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  The PWM driver interface module is joined (at link time) to an
 *  array of PWM_Config data structures named *PWM_config*.
 *  PWM_config is implemented in the application with each entry being a
 *  PWM instance. Each entry in *PWM_config* contains a:
 *  - (PWM_FxnTable *) to a set of functions that implement a PWM peripheral
 *  - (void *) data object that is associated with the PWM_FxnTable
 *  - (void *) hardware attributes that are associated with the PWM_FxnTable
 *
 *  The PWM APIs are redirected to the device specific implementations
 *  using the PWM_FxnTable pointer of the PWM_config entry.
 *  In order to use device specific functions of the PWM driver directly,
 *  link in the correct driver library for your device and include the
 *  device specific PWM driver header file (which in turn includes PWM.h).
 *  For example, for the MSP432 family of devices, you would include the
 *  following header file:
 *    @code
 *    #include <ti/drivers/pwm/PWMTimerMSP432.h>
 *    @endcode
