 *
 * The Xilinx timer/counter component. This component supports the Xilinx
 * timer/counter. More detailed description of the driver operation can
 * be found in the xtmrctr.c file.
 *
 * The Xilinx timer/counter supports the following features:
 *   - Polled mode.
 *   - Interrupt driven mode
 *   - enabling and disabling specific timers
 *   - PWM operation
 *   - Cascade Operation (This is to be used for getting a 64 bit timer and this
 *     feature is present in the latest versions of the axi_timer IP)
 *
 * The driver does not currently support the PWM operation of the device.
 *
 * The timer counter operates in 2 primary modes, compare and capture. In
 * either mode, the timer counter may count up or down, with up being the
 * default.
 *
 * Compare mode is typically used for creating a single time period or multiple
 * repeating time periods in the auto reload mode, such as a periodic interrupt.
 * When started, the timer counter loads an initial value, referred to as the
 * compare value, into the timer counter and starts counting down or up. The
 * timer counter expires when it rolls over/under depending upon the mode of
 * counting. An external compare output signal may be configured such that a
 * pulse is generated with this signal when it hits the compare value.
 *
 * Capture mode is typically used for measuring the time period between
 * external events. This mode uses an external capture input signal to cause
 * the value of the timer counter to be captured. When started, the timer
 * counter loads an initial value, referred to as the compare value,
 *
 * The timer can be configured to either cause an interrupt when the count
 * reaches the compare value in compare mode or latch the current count
 * value in the capture register when an external input is asserted
 * in capture mode. The external capture input can be enabled/disabled using the
 * XTmrCtr_SetOptions function. While in compare mode, it is also possible to
 * drive an external output when the compare value is reached in the count
 * register The external compare output can be enabled/disabled using the
 * XTmrCtr_SetOptions function.
 *
 * <b>Interrupts</b>
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the application to connect the interrupt
 * handler of the timer/counter to the interrupt source. The interrupt
 * handler function, XTmrCtr_InterruptHandler, is visible such that the user
 * can connect it to the interrupt source. Note that this interrupt handler
 * does not provide interrupt context save and restore processing, the user
 * must perform this processing.
 *
 * The driver services interrupts and passes timeouts to the upper layer
 * software through callback functions. The upper layer software must register
 * its callback functions during initialization. The driver requires callback
 * functions for timers.
 *
 * @note
 * The default settings for the timers are:
 *   - Interrupt generation disabled
 *   - Count up mode
 *   - Compare mode
 *   - Hold counter (will not reload the timer)
 *   - External compare output disabled
 *   - External capture input disabled
 *   - Pulse width modulation disabled
 *   - Timer disabled, waits for Start function to be called
 * <br><br>
 * A timer counter device may contain multiple timer counters. The symbol
 * XTC_DEVICE_TIMER_COUNT defines the number of timer counters in the device.
 * The device currently contains 2 timer counters.
 * <br><br>
 * This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. It works with
 * physical addresses only. Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads
 * or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be
 * satisfied by the layer above this driver.

 * <pre>
 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
 * 1.00a ecm  08/16/01 First release
 * 1.00b jhl  02/21/02 Repartitioned the driver for smaller files
 * 1.10b mta  03/21/07 Updated to new coding style.
 * 1.11a sdm  08/22/08 Removed support for static interrupt handlers from the MDD
 *		      file
 * 2.00a ktn  10/30/09 Updated to use HAL API's. _m is removed from all the macro
 *		      definitions.
 * 2.01a ktn  07/12/10 Renamed the macro XTimerCtr_ReadReg as XTmrCtr_ReadReg
 *		      for naming consistency (CR 559142).
 * 2.02a sdm  09/28/10 Updated the driver tcl to generate the xparameters
 *		      for the timer clock frequency (CR 572679).
 * 2.03a rvo  11/30/10 Added check to see if interrupt is enabled before further
 *		      processing for CR 584557.
 * 2.04a sdm  07/12/11 Added support for cascade mode operation.
 *            The cascade mode of operation is present in the latest
 *		      versions of the axi_timer IP. Please check the HW
 *		      Datasheet to see whether this feature is present in the
 *		      version of the IP that you are using.
 * 2.05a adk  15/05/13 Fixed the CR:693066
 *		      Added the IsStartedTmrCtr0/IsStartedTmrCtr1 members to the
 *		      XTmrCtr instance structure.
 *		      The IsStartedTmrCtrX will be assigned XIL_COMPONENT_IS_STARTED in
 *		      the XTmrCtr_Start function.
 *		      The IsStartedTmrCtrX will be cleared in the XTmrCtr_Stop function.
 *		      There will be no Initialization done in the
 *		      XTmrCtr_Initialize if both the timers have already started and
 *		      the XST_DEVICE_IS_STARTED Status is returned.
 *		      Removed the logic in the XTmrCtr_Initialize function
 *		      which was checking the Register Value to know whether
 *		      a timer has started or not.
 * 3.0   adk  19/12/13 Updated as per the New Tcl API's
 * 4.0   als  09/30/15 Updated initialization API.
 * 4.1   sk   11/10/15 Used UINTPTR instead of u32 for Baseaddress CR# 867425.
 *                     Changed the prototype of XTmrCtr_CfgInitialize API.
 * </pre>
