/* This application is using the FreeRTOS Windows simulator, which uses the
FreeRTOS scheduler to schedule FreeRTOS task within the Windows environment.
The Windows environment must not be allowed to block any Windows threads that
are running FreeRTOS tasks, unless the FreeRTOS task is running at the FreeRTOS
idle priority.  For simplicity, this demo uses the Windows TCP/IP stack, the
API for which can cause Windows threads to block.  Therefore, any FreeRTOS task
that makes calls to the Windows TCP/IP stack must be assigned the idle priority.
Note this is only a restriction of the simulated Windows environment - real
FreeRTOS ports do not have this restriction. */
