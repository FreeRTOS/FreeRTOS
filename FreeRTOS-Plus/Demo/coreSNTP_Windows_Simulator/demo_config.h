/**
 * @brief The list of 128-bit (or 16 bytes) symmetric keys for authenticating communication with the NTP/SNTP time servers
 * corresponding to the list in democonfigLIST_OF_TIME_SERVERS. A symmetric key is used for generating authentication code
 * in client request to related NTP/SNTP server as well as validating server from the time response received.
 *
 * This demo shows use of AES-128-CMAC algorithm for a mutual authentication mechanism in the SNTP communication
 * between the NTP/SNTP server and client. The demo generates a Message Authentication Code (MAC) using
 * the algorithm and appends it to the client request packet before the coreSNTP library sends it over
 * the network to the server. The server validates the client from the request from the authentication code
 * present in the request packet. Similarly, this demo validates the server from the response received on
 * the network by verifying the authentication code present in the response packet.
 *
 * It is RECOMMENDED to use an authentication mechanism for protecting devices against server spoofing
 * attacks.
 *
 * @note Even though this demo shows the use of AES-128-CMAC, a symmetric-key cryptographic based
 * solution, for authenticating SNTP communication between the demo (SNTP client) and
 * SNTP/NTP server, we instead RECOMMEND that production devices use the most secure authentication
 * mechanism alternative available with the Network Time Security (NTS) protocol, an asymmetric-key
 * cryptographic protocol. For more information, refer to the NTS specification here:
 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8915
 *
 * @note Please provide the 128-bit keys as comma separated list of hexadecimal strings in the order matching
 * the list of time servers configured in democonfigLIST_OF_TIME_SERVERS configuration. If a time server does
 * not support authentication, then NULL should be used to indicate use of no authentication mechanism for the
 * time server.
 *
 * @note Use of the AES-128-CMAC based authentication scheme in the demo requires that the symmetric key
 * is shared safely between the time server and the client device.

/**
 * @brief The year to bake in the demo application for initializing the system clock with.
 * The demo initializes the system clock time for the starting second of the 1st January of
 * the configured year. So for example, with a configuration of year 2021, the demo will
 * initialize the system clock time as 1st January 2021 00h:00m:00s.
 *
 * @note The coreSNTP library REQUIRES that the client system time is within ~68 years of internet
 * time. Thus, for systems that do not have an Real-Time Clock module, this demo shows how
 * a starting time can be baked in the device firmware to keep the starting time of the system
 * close to actual time on the first boot-up of device.
 * For such systems without Real-Time Clock module, all device boot ups from subsequent device resets
 * or power cycles can continue to carry close to correct time by EITHER
 *  * (RECOMMENDED) Saving the most recent time in non-volatile memory
 *     OR
 *  * Using the same firmware baked-in starting time of device for every boot-up.
