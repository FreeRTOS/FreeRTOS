/**
 * @brief Creates all the tasks for TZ demo.
 *
 * The Trust Zone (TZ) demo creates an unprivileged task which calls a secure
 * side function and passes a pointer to a callback function. The secure side
 * function does two things:
 * 1. It calls the provided callback function. The callback function increments
 * a counter.
 * 2. It increments a counter and returns the incremented value.
 * After the secure function call finishes, it verifies that both the counters
 * are incremented.
