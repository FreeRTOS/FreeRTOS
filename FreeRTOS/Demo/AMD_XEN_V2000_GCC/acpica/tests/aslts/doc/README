   miscellaneous descriptive information

docs

   designing the Source Operand Complex test (and similar)
   was quite complicated work; to concentarate on the main
   aspects of it and to prove ourselves being on the proper
   way and break hesitating in details these principles were
   outlined (file TestOfOperands); principles could be useful
   in general to design ASL tests

plan

   remaining work, our ideas about which more tests should be
   designed, the time and priority of work estimation

StoreCopyTestPrototype

   these demo programs may be considered as a prototypes
   of separate functional tests for CopyObject and Store
   operators

CurrentState

   remarks about the current state of tests; for example
   some sub-tests of tests are suppressed due to the fact
   they cause abort of execution; after fixing the root
   problems in ACPICA these sub-tests must be enabled;
   these and similar information about the tests is here
