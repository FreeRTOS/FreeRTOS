/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting (defined in this file) is used to
 * select between the two.  The simply blinky demo is implemented and described
 * in main_blinky.c.  The more comprehensive test and demo application is
 * implemented and described in main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup, standard FreeRTOS hook functions, and the ISR hander called
 * by the RTOS after interrupt entry (including nesting) has been taken care of.
 *
 * ENSURE TO READ THE DOCUMENTATION PAGE FOR THIS PORT AND DEMO APPLICATION ON
 * THE http://www.FreeRTOS.org WEB SITE FOR FULL INFORMATION ON USING THIS DEMO
 * APPLICATION, AND ITS ASSOCIATE FreeRTOS ARCHITECTURE PORT!
