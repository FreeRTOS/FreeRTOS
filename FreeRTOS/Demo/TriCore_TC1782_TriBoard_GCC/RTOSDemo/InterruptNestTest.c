/*
 * It is intended that the tasks and timers in this file cause interrupts to
 * nest at least one level deeper than they would otherwise.
 *
 * A timer is configured to create an interrupt at moderately high frequency,
 * as defined by the tmrtestHIGH_FREQUENCY_TIMER_TEST_HZ constant.  The
 * interrupt priority is by configHIGH_FREQUENCY_TIMER_PRIORITY, which is set
 * to ( configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY - 1UL ), the second highest
 * priority from which interrupt safe FreeRTOS API calls can be made.
 *
 * The timer interrupt handler counts the number of times it is called.  When
 * it has determined that the number of calls means that 10ms has passed, it
 * 'gives' a semaphore, and resets it call count.
 *
 * A high priority task is used to receive the data posted to the queue by the
 * interrupt service routine.  The task should, then, leave the blocked state
 * and 'take' the available semaphore every 10ms.  The frequency at which it
 * actually leaves the blocked state is verified by the demo's check task (see
 * the the documentation for the entire demo on the FreeRTOS.org web site),
 * which then flags an error if the frequency lower than expected.
