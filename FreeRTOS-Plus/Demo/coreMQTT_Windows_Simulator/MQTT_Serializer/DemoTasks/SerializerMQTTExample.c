/*
 * Demo for showing use of the MQTT serializer API.
 * The MQTT serializer API allows the user to serialize and
 * deserialize MQTT messages into a user provided buffer.
 * This API allows use of a statically allocated buffer.
 *
 * The example shown below uses this API to create MQTT messages and
 * send them over the connection established using FreeRTOS sockets.
 * The example is single threaded and uses statically allocated memory;
 * it uses QOS0 and therefore does not implement any retransmission
 * mechanism for Publish messages.
 *
 * !!! NOTE !!!
 * This MQTT demo does not authenticate the server or the client.
 * Hence, this demo code is not recommended to be used in production
 * systems requiring secure connections.
