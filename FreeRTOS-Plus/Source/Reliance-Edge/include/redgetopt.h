/** @file
    @brief Interfaces for getopt() and getopt_long() work-alike functions.

    This code was taken from FreeBSD and slightly modified, mostly to rename
    symbols with external linkage to avoid naming conflicts in systems where
    there are real getopt()/getopt_long() implementations.  Changed to use
    fixed-width types to allow code using these interfaces to be consistent
    with the rest of the product.
