/*******************************************************************************
 * Trace Recorder Library for Tracealyzer v4.3.11
 * Percepio AB, www.percepio.com
 *
 * trcStreamingPort.c
 *
 * This stream port provides trace streaming using the Amazon FreeRTOS sockets
 * layer and is intended for streaming over Wifi directly to a computer on the
 * local Wifi network. 
 *
 * Note that this does NOT use the TLS encryption available in Amazon
 * FreeRTOS, due to performance and memory usage concerns. However, it does not
 * use any AWS services either, and is intended for your local network only.
 *
 * This should be started using vTraceEnable(TRC_START) and this call should be
 * made AFTER the kernel has started and the Wifi interface is ready.
 *
 * In the Tracealyzer setting -> "PSF Streaming Settings" make sure that the
 * "Target Connection" setting is "TCP (Target Initiated)".
 *
 * To use this, make sure to start the trace recording in Tracealyzer before
 * you start your target system. This ensures that Tracealyzer is ready when
 * the target system connects.
 *
 * And don't forget to enter the IP address of the Tracealyzer host computer
 * in trcStreamingPort.h.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1: The tracing will increase the stack usage of you application, so you
 * may want to increase configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE in your FreeRTOSConfig.h.
 *
 * 2: To reduce the amount of trace data, we recommend disabling the tracing
 * of OS Ticks and memory allocation events.
 * See TRC_CFG_INCLUDE_OSTICK_EVENTS in trcConfig.h.
 *
 * 3: The transmission of trace data is done in the TzCtrl task. To avoid that
 * the trace streaming is blocked during the (long) MQTT connection phase,
 * make sure the scheduling priority of TzCtrl is higher than the MQTT task.
 * Otherwise, if you prefer to run the TzCtrl task at lower priority to avoid
 * interfering with your application, wait with the vTraceEnable call until
 * after the MQTT connection is established.
 * See TRC_CFG_CTRL_TASK_PRIORITY in trcStreamingConfig.h.
 *
 * 4: The Wifi transmission of trace data often uses FreeRTOS functions, that
 * are traced and thus produce additional trace data. This may cause a fast
 * increase in trace data rate, that may saturate the trace buffer and cause
 * data loss (i.e. incomplete traces).
 * To eliminate this effect and reduce the amount of trace data produced, we
 * recommend excluding all FreeRTOS objects that are used by Wifi stack.
 * This is done using vTraceSetFilterGroup and vTraceSetFilterMask:
 *
 *   // Just before wifi initialization:
 *
 *   // All objects created after this point are assigned to group 15.
 *   vTraceSetFilterGroup(FilterGroup15);
 *
 *   // Only trace objects assigned to group 0 (the default group).
 *   vTraceSetFilterMask(FilterGroup0);
 *
 *   // The wifi stack initialization... (creates semaphores etc.)
 *   if ( eWifi_Connected == prvWifiConnect() )
 *   {
 *       yMainState = eMain_StartApplication;
 *
 *       // When connected, restore the FilterGroup setting to Group 0, so
 *       // that later created objects are included, like the TzCtrl task
 *       // created in vTraceEnable. Excluding tasks is not recommended!
 *       vTraceSetFilterGroup(FilterGroup0);
 *
 *       // Then call vTraceEnable to start the tracing.
 *       vTraceEnable(TRC_START);
 *   }
 *
 * 5: If you still get "red sections" in Tracealyzer (lost data), you need
 * to adjust the other settings in trcStreamingConfig.h.
 *
 *   - TRC_CFG_PAGED_EVENT_BUFFER_PAGE_COUNT
 *     Increase this, as long as you have memory to spare.
 *
 *   - TRC_CFG_PAGED_EVENT_BUFFER_PAGE_SIZE
 *     Increase this, as long as you have memory to spare.
 *     But don't exceed the maximum payload size of the Wifi chip, which
 *     is often limited to 1000-1500 bytes. Some chips crash if you try to
 *     send to large chunks...
 *
 *   - TRC_CFG_CTRL_TASK_DELAY
 *     Decrease this to flush the trace buffer more frequently.
