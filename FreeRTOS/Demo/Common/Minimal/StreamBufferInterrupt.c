/*
 * A simple example that shows a stream buffer being used to pass data from an
 * interrupt to a task.
 *
 * There are two strings, pcStringToSend and pcStringToReceive, where
 * pcStringToReceive is a substring of pcStringToSend.  The interrupt sends
 * a few bytes of pcStringToSend to a stream buffer ever few times that it
 * executes.  A task reads the bytes from the stream buffer, looking for the
 * substring, and flagging an error if the received data is invalid.
