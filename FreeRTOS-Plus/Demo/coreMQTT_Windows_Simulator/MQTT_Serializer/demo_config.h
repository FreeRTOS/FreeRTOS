/**
 * @brief MQTT broker end point to connect to.
 *
 * @note For running this demo an MQTT broker, which can be run locally on
 * the same host is recommended. Any MQTT broker, which can be run on a Windows
 * host can be used for this demo. However, the instructions below are for
 * setting up a local Mosquitto broker on a Windows host.
 * 1. Download Mosquitto from https://mosquitto.org/download/
 * 2. Install Mosquitto as a Windows service by running the installer.
 * More details about installing as a Windows service can be found at
 * https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/blob/master/readme-windows.txt and
 * https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/blob/master/readme.md
 * 3. Verify that Mosquitto server is running locally and listening on port
 * 1883 by following the steps below.
 *     a. Open Power Shell.
 *     b. Type in command `netstat -a -p TCP | grep 1883` to check if there
 *        is an active connection listening on port 1883.
 *     c. Verify that there is an output as shown below
 *        `TCP    0.0.0.0:1883           <HOST-NAME>:0       LISTENING`
 *     d. If there is no output on step c,go through the Mosquitto documentation
 *        listed above to check if the installation was successful.
 * 4. Make sure the Mosquitto broker is allowed to communicate through
 * Windows Firewall. The instructions for allowing an application on Windows 10
 * Defender Firewall can be found at the link below.
 * https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4558235/windows-10-allow-an-app-through-microsoft-defender-firewall
 * After running this MQTT example, consider disabling the Mosquitto broker to
 * communicate through Windows Firewall for avoiding unwanted network traffic
 * to your machine.
 * 5. After verifying that a Mosquitto broker is running successfully, update
 * the config democonfigMQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT to the local IP address of the
 * Windows host machine. Please note that "localhost" or address "127.0.0.1"
 * will not work as this example is running on a Windows Simulator and not on
 * Windows host natively. Also note that, if the Windows host is using a
 * Virtual Private Network(VPN), connection to the Mosquitto broker may not
 * work.
 *
 * #define democonfigMQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT				"insert here."
