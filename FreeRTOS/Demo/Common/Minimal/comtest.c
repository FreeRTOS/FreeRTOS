/*
 * This version of comtest. c is for use on systems that have limited stack
 * space and no display facilities.  The complete version can be found in
 * the Demo/Common/Full directory.
 *
 * Creates two tasks that operate on an interrupt driven serial port.  A
 * loopback connector should be used so that everything that is transmitted is
 * also received.  The serial port does not use any flow control.  On a
 * standard 9way 'D' connector pins two and three should be connected together.
 *
 * The first task posts a sequence of characters to the Tx queue, toggling an
 * LED on each successful post.  At the end of the sequence it sleeps for a
 * pseudo-random period before resending the same sequence.
 *
 * The UART Tx end interrupt is enabled whenever data is available in the Tx
 * queue.  The Tx end ISR removes a single character from the Tx queue and
 * passes it to the UART for transmission.
 *
 * The second task blocks on the Rx queue waiting for a character to become
 * available.  When the UART Rx end interrupt receives a character it places
 * it in the Rx queue, waking the second task.  The second task checks that the
 * characters removed from the Rx queue form the same sequence as those posted
 * to the Tx queue, and toggles an LED for each correct character.
 *
 * The receiving task is spawned with a higher priority than the transmitting
 * task.  The receiver will therefore wake every time a character is
 * transmitted so neither the Tx or Rx queue should ever hold more than a few
 * characters.
 *
