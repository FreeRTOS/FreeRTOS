/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the comprehensive test and demo version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * full demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware, along with an example of how to write an
 * interrupt service routine, are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_full() creates all the demo application tasks and two software timers,
 * then starts the scheduler.  The web documentation provides more details of
 * the standard demo application tasks, which provide no particular
 * functionality, but do provide a good example of how to use the FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks, tests and
 * timers are created within this file:
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill the registers with known values, then check
 * that each register still contains its expected value.  Each task uses a
 * different set of values.  The reg test tasks execute with a very low priority,
 * so get preempted very frequently.  A register containing an unexpected value
 * is indicative of an error in the context switching mechanism.
 *
 * The "Demo" Timer and Callback Function:
 * The demo timer callback function does nothing more than increment a variable.
 * The period of the demo timer is set relative to the period of the check timer
 * (described below).  This allows the check timer to know how many times the
 * demo timer callback function should execute between each execution of the
 * check timer callback function.  The variable incremented in the demo timer
 * callback function is used to determine how many times the callback function
 * has executed.
 *
 * The "Check" Timer and Callback Function:
 * The check timer period is initially set to three seconds.  The check timer
 * callback function checks that all the standard demo tasks, the reg test
 * tasks, and the demo timer are not only still executing, but are executing
 * without reporting any errors.  If the check timer discovers that a task or
 * timer has stalled, or reported an error, then it changes its own period from
 * the initial three seconds, to just 200ms.  The check timer callback function
 * also toggles an LED each time it is called.  This provides a visual
 * indication of the system status:  If the LED toggles every three seconds,
 * then no issues have been discovered.  If the LED toggles every 200ms, then
 * an issue has been discovered with at least one task.
 *
 * ENSURE TO READ THE DOCUMENTATION PAGE FOR THIS PORT AND DEMO APPLICATION ON
 * THE http://www.FreeRTOS.org WEB SITE FOR FULL INFORMATION ON USING THIS DEMO
 * APPLICATION, AND ITS ASSOCIATE FreeRTOS ARCHITECTURE PORT!
