/** @file
    @brief Interface for the Reliance Edge FSE API.

    The FSE (File Systems Essentials) API is a minimalist file system API
    intended for simple use cases with a fixed number of statically-defined
    files.  It does not support creating or deleting files dynamically.  Files
    are referenced by a fixed file number, rather than by name; there are no
    file names and no directories.  There are also no file handles: files are
    not opened or closed, and file offsets are given explicitly.

    If the FSE API is too limited to meet the needs of your application,
    consider using the more feature-rich POSIX-like file system API instead.
