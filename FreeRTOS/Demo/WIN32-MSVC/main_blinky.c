/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE: Windows will not be running the FreeRTOS demo threads continuously, so
 * do not expect to get real time behaviour from the FreeRTOS Windows port, or
 * this demo application.  Also, the timing information in the FreeRTOS+Trace
 * logs have no meaningful units.  See the documentation page for the Windows
 * port for further information:
 * http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Windows-Simulator-Emulator-for-Visual-Studio-and-Eclipse-MingW.html
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the simply blinky version.  Console output
 * is used in place of the normal LED toggling.
 *
 * NOTE 3:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * basic demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, are defined
 * in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_blinky() creates one queue, one software timer, and two tasks.  It then
 * starts the scheduler.
 *
 * The Queue Send Task:
 * The queue send task is implemented by the prvQueueSendTask() function in
 * this file.  It uses vTaskDelayUntil() to create a periodic task that sends
 * the value 100 to the queue every 200 milliseconds (please read the notes
 * above regarding the accuracy of timing under Windows).
 *
 * The Queue Send Software Timer:
 * The timer is a one-shot timer that is reset by a key press.  The timer's
 * period is set to two seconds - if the timer expires then its callback
 * function writes the value 200 to the queue.  The callback function is
 * implemented by prvQueueSendTimerCallback() within this file.
 *
 * The Queue Receive Task:
 * The queue receive task is implemented by the prvQueueReceiveTask() function
 * in this file.  prvQueueReceiveTask() waits for data to arrive on the queue.
 * When data is received, the task checks the value of the data, then outputs a
 * message to indicate if the data came from the queue send task or the queue
 * send software timer.
 *
 * Expected Behaviour:
 * - The queue send task writes to the queue every 200ms, so every 200ms the
 *   queue receive task will output a message indicating that data was received
 *   on the queue from the queue send task.
 * - The queue send software timer has a period of two seconds, and is reset
 *   each time a key is pressed.  So if two seconds expire without a key being
 *   pressed then the queue receive task will output a message indicating that
 *   data was received on the queue from the queue send software timer.
 *
 * NOTE:  Console input and output relies on Windows system calls, which can
 * interfere with the execution of the FreeRTOS Windows port.  This demo only
 * uses Windows system call occasionally.  Heavier use of Windows system calls
 * can crash the port.
