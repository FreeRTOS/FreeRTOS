/**
 * This file exercises the event mechanism whereby more than one task is
 * blocked waiting for the same event.
 *
 * The demo creates five tasks - four 'event' tasks, and a controlling task.
 * The event tasks have various different priorities and all block on reading
 * the same queue.  The controlling task writes data to the queue, then checks
 * to see which of the event tasks read the data from the queue.  The
 * controlling task has the lowest priority of all the tasks so is guaranteed
 * to always get preempted immediately upon writing to the queue.
 *
 * By selectively suspending and resuming the event tasks the controlling task
 * can check that the highest priority task that is blocked on the queue is the
 * task that reads the posted data from the queue.
 *
 * Two of the event tasks share the same priority.  When neither of these tasks
 * are suspended they should alternate - one reading one message from the queue,
 * the other the next message, etc.
