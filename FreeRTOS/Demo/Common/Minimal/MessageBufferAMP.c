/*
 * An example that mimics a message buffer being used to pass data from one core
 * to another.  The core that sends the data is referred to as core A.  The core
 * that receives the data is referred to as core B.  The task implemented by
 * prvCoreATask() runs on core A.  Two instances of the task implemented by
 * prvCoreBTasks() run on core B.  prvCoreATask() sends messages via message
 * buffers to both instances of prvCoreBTasks(), one message buffer per channel.
 * A third message buffer is used to pass the handle of the message buffer
 * written to by core A to an interrupt service routine that is triggered by
 * core A but executes on core B.
 *
 * The example relies on the FreeRTOS provided default implementation of
 * sbSEND_COMPLETED() being overridden by an implementation in FreeRTOSConfig.h
 * that writes the handle of the message buffer that contains data into the
 * control message buffer, then generates an interrupt in core B.  The necessary
 * implementation is provided in this file and can be enabled by adding the
 * following to FreeRTOSConfig.h:
 *
 * #define sbSEND_COMPLETED( pxStreamBuffer ) vGenerateCoreBInterrupt( pxStreamBuffer )
 *
 * Core to core communication via message buffer requires the message buffers
 * to be at an address known to both cores within shared memory.
 *
 * Note that, while this example uses three message buffers, the same
 * functionality can be implemented using a single message buffer by using the
 * same design pattern described on the link below for queues, but using message
 * buffers instead.  It is actually simpler with a message buffer as variable
 * length data can be written into the message buffer directly:
 * http://www.freertos.org/Pend-on-multiple-rtos-objects.html#alternative_design_pattern
