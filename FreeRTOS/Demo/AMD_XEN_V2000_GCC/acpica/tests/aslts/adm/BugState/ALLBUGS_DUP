| About how INTEGRATED was set up:
|
|   (did not check the code update, but only PASS of test): 58,119,169,171
|
| About how FIXED was set up:
|
|   checked out visually: 53
|
| About how REJECTED was set up:
|
|  88 -- duplicate of 90
| 170 -- duplicate of 191
|
| Specs:
|
| 37,51,147:
| the bugs are filed against specification, so the expected result
| is fixing ACPI specification. It should be checked out manually
| that the relevant part of specification is actually fixed/updated.
| After that write manually INTEGRATED key in the STATE-MANUALLY
| column of the relevant bug to confirm completion of bug. Some
| these bugs against specs may nevertheless have the relevant bdemo
| tests which make use just of the relevant functionality touched
| by the part of specification. But nevertheless PASS of these
| tests is not enough to set up INTEGRATED for these bugs of specs.
