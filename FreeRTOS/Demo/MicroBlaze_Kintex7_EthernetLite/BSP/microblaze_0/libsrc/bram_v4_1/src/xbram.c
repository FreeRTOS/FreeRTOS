/**
 * Initialize the XBram instance provided by the caller based on the given
 * configuration data.
 *
 * Nothing is done except to initialize the InstancePtr.
 *
 * @param	InstancePtr is a pointer to an XBram instance.
 *		The memory the pointer references must be pre-allocated by
 *		the caller. Further calls to manipulate the driver through
 *		the XBram API must be made with this pointer.
 * @param	Config is a reference to a structure containing information
 *		about a specific BRAM device. This function
 *		initializes an InstancePtr object for a specific device
 *		specified by the contents of Config. This function can
 *		initialize multiple instance objects with the use of multiple
 *		calls giving different Config information on each call.
 * @param   EffectiveAddr is the device base address in the virtual memory
 *		address space. The caller is responsible for keeping the
 *		address	mapping from EffectiveAddr to the device physical base
 *		address	unchanged once this function is invoked. Unexpected
 *		errors may occur if the address mapping changes after this
 *		function is called. If address translation is not used, use
 *		Config->BaseAddress for this parameters, passing the physical
 *		address instead.

 * @return
 *      - XST_SUCCESS	Initialization was successful.
