Some information can be obsolete.

It was useful when we started designing the tests to
attempt to gather ideas about the subject of testing
and approach of testing.
================================




   Source Operand Complex test specification
       (guideline of designing the test)

Collection of remarks not intended to constitute the facile
joined statement. These considerations should be taken into
account while designing the Source Operand Complex test.
Some of them are applicable in general while designing the
ASL tests.

All the ASL declarartions allowed by the ASL compiler have to
work in compliance with the ACPI specification, in a predictable
and convenient for users manner (so, ACPI could be changed as well).

Outlined are the subject of testing, the main aspects of it,
the main points to be concentrated on while designing the test
and the practical steps which should be performed to achieve the
worthy coverage of the test. Also the objective difficulties
which are on that way are explained.

This text is for ourselves in the first order.
Allow, some statements to be abstract, non-strict and questionable.
Bilieve, the abstraction will be useful.

Writing the Operand Complex test is quite complicated
(it is not a functional test were you simply verify each
feature separately), so after implementing some its part you
see some ASL functionality is involved by test repeatedly though
you thought about different things. This text is in particular
intended to enumerate all the aspects to be verified, and don't
further hesitate if all them are applied.

The intention of the test is to verify all the grammar rules
of specifying and delivering operands to operators.

This is a wide range of issues which are simpler to understand and
embrace given together as a separate particular topic, as a separate
approach. Each the particular relevant aspect should be given separately,
the approach of how to test it should be designed and then applied to all
the ASL operators. Then the next aspect should be taken separately and
also verified for all the operators. This would allow to concentrate
deeply on each aspect and to observe the coverage provided by the test
which would be impossible to do in the contrary case when the
per-operator tests each contains all the aspects checkings.

All the relevant aspects should be verified for each particular operator
(or at least for one member of each group of operators divided according
to the considered aspects of delivering operands to operators if only you
can found such division to groups). While building the tests we have
observed many confirmations of the idea that aspects of delivering
operands to operators can work differently for different operators,
while being proper for some of them it fails for other.

Minimum functionality of operators should be involved there to prove
only the fact that operands are delivered to operators correctly.
To check functionality of operators is up to other tests.

The test should also check that the source values which were
referred to as parameters were not corrupted by the execution
of the particular operator, which are the situations being in
practice revealed by our other tests many times.

The test verifies processing of both the valid operands and
invalid operands. Building the invalid operand checkings is a simple
task - pass operator with the inappropriate type operand and check that
the exception occurs. So, below are mostly about the valid operand checkings.

The valid operand checkings verify all the legal ways of specifying and
delivering operands to ASL operators. The following section describes the
essential aspects of that process.

Note: some particularities are obsolete due to the change of ACPI
      specification since that.


   ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF OPERAND DELIVERING
   =======================================

IMAGES

  All the vatiety of ways specifying the immediate images of ASL objects
of all types should be represented. All the types are given in the table
17-20 of ACPI specification:

     Uninitialized
   * Integer
   * String
   * Buffer
   * Package
   * Field Unit
     Device
     Event
     Method
     Mutex
     Operation Region
     Power Resource
     Processor
     Thermal Zone
   * Buffer Field
     DDB Handle

  (*) - computational types. The table #1 below shows
        all the variety of computational type images
   () - the remained types are mostly used in the
        invalid operand checkings


LOCATIONS

  The location of the object in the name space relating
to the operator where that object is utilized.

  - statically accessible global object
    located immediately in the DefinitionBlock
  - statically accessible declared locally in the current scope
  - statically accessible declared locally in the surrounding upper
    scope, (1,2,3,...,LOC_LEVELS levels up)
  - inaccessible statically, declared locally in the sequence
    of the calling methods, (1,2,3,...,LOC_LEVELS levels up)

  Note: all the functionality of all scope generating concepts:
        DefinitionBlock, Scope, Device, Method, Function, Processor,
        PowerResource, ThermalZone,... will be verified in the
        relevant complex tests, not here.

  Note: it was observed earlier that logical operators
        didn't cause exceptions when using references.
        This looks incorrect. Keep attention to that.
        Don't forget to build the test for it.

  Note: specification of Reference test contains more exact list.

EXPRESSIONS

  The way how the object is specified
for operator in place of operand.

  - immediate image
  - ArgX
  - LocalX
  - NamedX
  - expression as such, immediate result of other operators
   (references are some of operators as well) like this:
      Operator(Operator(Operator(Operator(...))))
      Operator([Operand,]Operator([Operand,]Operator(...)))
    Depth: 1,2,3,...,EXP_LEVELS
  - use execution of other Methods as a kind of expressions as well

  Note: expressions in place of locations for results
        (Destinations) should be verified in this test
        as well, because together with the expressions
        of operands they can influence each other.

  Issue: expressions in result, is that possible to use?

METHODS

- use Methods as elements of expressions
- use all kind expressions as parameters to Methods 


CONVERSION

  The Implicit Source Operand Conversion functionality
(17.2.5.7 Data Type Conversion Rules) should be verified also.

The table # 1 below proposes the particular values for to initiate
all the variety of Implicit Source Operand Conversion rules.


OPERATORS

   As it was mentioned above, the particular target operator
can impact delivering operands to it. Thus, we can't build the test
for only one particular operator but should be bent on building the
checkings for many (to all is the best) of them or for one member of
each group (if manage found division). An aspect can work correctly
while delivering operand to one operator but fail while delivering
to other.

Pay attention to both:

   - the complete and the reduced forms of operators
   - the target operators and operators used in expressions


MISCELLANEOUS

   Additional miscellaneous features, particular situations
which should be verified. They are descended from the aspects
above (as the particular elements of an absolute test (see below)).
These notes allow to keep additional attention to them. They look
to be a complicated modes for ACPICA.

Note: add this aspect with more new complicated checkings.

   1. Use the same object more than one time in expressions of
operands and destinations:

    - in expression of one operand of target operator
    - in expressions of different operands of the target operator
    - in expression of one operand and the result is stored into the object
    - in expressions of different operands of target operator and
      the result is located into the object...
    - in other words, continue combinations of these features:

      (one operand)/(some (all) operands)
      (one operator)/(several operators)
      (store result in it)/(don't store result in it)...

   2. Pass the object of upper level (or even global) accessible
statically by ArgX of sequence of calling methods (operand1) and
specify the same object as another operand immediately by its NameX
(operand2) and use them both in turn (operand1/operand2) as locations
for result.

   3. Other cases.


   ABSOLUTE TEST ABSTRACTION
   =========================

   So, all the aspects which can impact delivering operands to operators
and thus should be verified are these:

  Images
  Locations
  References
  Expressions 
  Methods 
  Conversion
  Operators
  Miscellaneous

   The more you mix these aspects the more comprehensive test you
have. Each impact generated and verified by test is a function of
(N1,N2,N3,N4,N5,N6,N7,N8) parameters. So, to build the total absolute
comprehensive test we have to build and verify all the possible
combinations of these input states.

In this case we will miss nothing and the total coverage of testing
the operand delivering will be achieved.

To build the test as a simple enumeration and verification
of all possible combinations of given above parameters would be
the simplest way. Though it would be usually much redundant we
would be happy and assured that the total coverage would be
actually achieved.

  Note: what actually is the mix of these (N1-N8) aspects?


   REALITY, LIMITATIONS OF ACPICA ASL
   ==================================

   But there are several limitations of ACPICA ASL which make
such simplest and the total coverage assured approach (absolute
test) impossible, because they prevent automated processing.
About all that below. In consequence of all that, it is remained
only to rely on the human factor, intuition and skill to achieve
the worthy coverage of the test.

   Elements of ASL Package could be only Integer, String, Buffer
and Package type objects. Other type objects could not be represented
immediately in Package. So, it is impossible to collect all the
desirable different type objects in Package and then refer them
in cycle.

   We can't pass Method with the Uninitialized object, so these
conditions should be also provided by the test as the immediate
references to the Uninitialized objects which prevents automated
processing as well.

   One more inconvenience for testing arises from the type conversion
functionality. Due to that some type objects could not be represented
not only as elements of Package, but also be passed to Method as parameters
(Buffer Field, Field Unit, etc..), since they are converted to either Integer
or Buffer types in the latter case. As a result, these conditions should
be provided by the test immediately also and can not be referred in cycle.

   The are similar limitations on return from method as well.

   Some groups of operators (Concatenate; Logical operators) have
particularities of Implicit Source Operand Conversion functionality
which also restricts uniformity of test for different operators.

   So, we can't run in cycle all the possible desirable combinations
(and aspects) of operands for all the ASL operators, because the ASL
limitations don't allow to achieve uniformity of the test building.
It is impossible to build the test which simply enumerates all
combinations and so achieve the total coverage. One more, such the
test will go during the huge boundless time.

   Thus, it is up to the skill of the designer of the test to choose
the main points to be verified in order to build the test which would
achieve the worthy coverage for the acceptable time of execution.

   So, maybe, attempt to divide operators on groups according to
the specific of their operands and one operator of each group verify
comprehensively, while other members of groups verify in a simplified
manner. Do that if the run time of the test increases extremely.

   So, because of the ASL limitations described above we can't implement
the comprehencive test, which would be proven to approximate to the absolute
test on coverage. But this specification and the tests adhered to it would
allow us to feel ourselves to be on the firm way to achieve the worthy coverage
and consider that we have done all needed from our side to achieve the
comprehencive tests.

   So, due to the limitations of ASL above, we refuse attempts to write the
common engine which would simplify our work and ensure the high coverage of
test. Nevertheless, write and apply where possible the common use methods.


Bugs of product revealed must be fixed in real time! Very, very much important!
Basing on the proper functionality provided by the target product you achieve
more and more deep testing. Once again, it is very much important. Otherwise,
the testing turns sour.



   COMPUTATIONAL DATA IMMEDIATE IMAGES

   The table below contains the recommended variety of immediate images
for computational types: Integer, String, Buffer, Buffer Field, Field Unit,
Package. The table pretends to enumerate all the variety of them.

(the Implicit Source Operand Conversion Rules are marked in the table #x
with (*). They are ... in this table. For example 8,32:b4,b25,b28 means ...)

Note: the Implicit Rules were a few changed since that!


    START WITH THESE OPERATORS  (and maybe don't go beyond that)
    ==========================


This is a list of operators which are recommended
to be implemented in the first turn.

List of operators which should be verified completely (all the
aspects of delivering operands to them should be verified).

One-parameter operators:

   - Increment
   - Decrement
   - FindSetLeftBit
   - one of these: ToBuffer, ToDecimalString,
                   ToHexString, ToInteger,
                   ToBCD, FromBCD
   - Not
   - SizeOf
   - Store
   - CopyObject

   All other one-parameter operators may be verified partially.

Two-parameters operators:

   - Add
   - Divide
   - Multiply
   - LGreater
   - ToString
   - Concatenate
   - ShiftLeft
   - Lor
   - NAnd
   - XOr

   All other two-parameters operators may be verified partially.

Three-parameters operators:

   - Mid

Six-parameters operators:

   - Match

The tests of operands for the following operators
may be implemented separately in their per-operator tests:

  - If,Elseif
  - While

The positive (not exceptions) tests of operands for the
following operators have been done in per-operator tests:

  - Switch, Case

   STRUCTURE OF TEST
   =================

1. Sub-test for aspect 1, verifications for all operators.
2. Sub-test for aspect 2, verifications for all operators.
N. Sub-test for aspect N, verifications for all operators.

The valid operand checkings and invalid operand checkings
should be structurized as different runs  - no exceptions
should be exercised during the valid operand checkings
execution.

   PARTICULAR INFORMATION
   ======================

Buffer Field operators should be passed directly only because ASL
doesn't allow to pass Buffer Field type objects without conversion
(they are converted to either Integer or Buffer types).

Allocate Buffer Fields for both operands from the same buffer
(Buffer(20){}). Fill the entire Buffer with the zeros (units),
then fill the fields with the units (zeros) and check the contents
of the whole Buffer after Operator completion.

Results should be written into LocalX, not to involve the
"Implicit Result Object Conversion".

Perhaps, groups of operators can have the same checkings which can
be handled by the same methods (with different benchmark values) so
simplifying the designing of tests. But the rest of checkings should
be provided by the actions individual for the particular operators.


   BRIEF RECOMMENDATIONS (summary from above)
   =====================

   There should be the most important or usually forgotten things

 1. use all type immediate Images
 2. use all type Locations
 3. use all type References
 4. use all type Expressions
 5. use Methods in expressions and expressions as parameters to Methods 
 6. initiate all kind of Implicit Source Operand Conversion
 7. exercise all Operators
 8. apply recommendations given in Miscellaneous section
 9. use full and reduced forms of operators (mean optional Results)
10. use zero length Buffers
11. use uninitialized elements of Packages
12. use non-computational elements of Packages to (initiate/NOT initiate)
    exceptions during conversion (Match..)
13. use Packages: uninitialized,...,uninitialized,<valid_value>
14. use all operators - ObjectType, SizeOf and LEqual to verify results
15. verify all the obtained results
16. check that the source objects were not corrupted by execution
    (use all - ObjectType, SizeOf and LEqual)
17. remember about the NULL symbols of strings
18. mix different (all) aspects; the more you mix aspects
    the more comprehensive test you have
19. add directives into Miscellaneous section and here while
    increasing your skill of building the test
20. use the same object (and several such objects)
    (ArgX,LocalX,Name(X)) in different operands and
    Destination of the same operator
21. use the same object (and several such objects)
    (ArgX,LocalX,Name(X)) in different operands of
    different operators of the same expression
22. do the input control (ObjectType, SizeOf, LEqual)
    of passed values (where needed)
23. check operators for unacceptable types of operands (exception occur)
24. for the acceptable types of operands check particular unacceptable
    values (exception occur)
25. check that the result is of the same type as the benchmark
    (use ObjectType, don't be satisfied with LEqual only)
26. the second operands of Logical operators are converted
    to the type of the first ones; do the checkings which
    show and confirm that
27. conversion of the second operands of Concatenate operator
    is performed according to the table; do the checkings which
    show and confirm that
28. use immediate invocations of operators in place of operands
    of other operators
29. each operand of several-operands oprerators should be verified
30. before running the operation initialize the destination area
    with the contr-data (zero expected, take unit; unit expected,
    take zero); so you see that result does actual change
