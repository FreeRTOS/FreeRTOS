Compare Units, and PWM support. It allows accurate program execution timing (event management) and
wave generation.

Features

* Initialization

Applications
------------
* PWM/Frequency generation
* Event counting/Input capture
* Application timing, and scheduling

Dependencies
------------
* clk\ :sub:`io` for clock
* Module is enabled by setting PRR.PRTIMn to 0

Note
----
* ISR will be generated only when Global Interrupt checkbox and driver_isr Harness checkbox are enabled
