 * This function runs a self-test on the driver and hardware device. This self
 * test performs a local loopback and verifies data can be sent and received.
 *
 * The time for this test is proportional to the baud rate that has been set
 * prior to calling this function.
 *
 * The mode and control registers are restored before return.
 *
 * @param	InstPtr is a pointer to the XDmaPs instance
 *
 * @return
 *
 *		- XST_SUCCESS if the test was successful
 *		- XST_FAILURE if the test failed
 *
 * @note
 *
 * This function can hang if the hardware is not functioning properly.
