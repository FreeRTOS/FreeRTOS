 * a starting time can be baked in the device firmware to keep the starting time of the system
 * close to actual time on the first boot-up of device.
 * For such systems without Real-Time Clock module, all device boot ups from subsequent device resets
 * or power cycles can continue to carry close to correct time by EITHER
 *  * (RECOMMENDED) Saving the most recent time in non-volatile memory
 *     OR
 *  * Using the same firmware baked-in starting time of device for every boot-up.
