/* 
 * This demo application creates eight co-routines and four tasks (five 
 * including the idle task).  The co-routines execute as part of the idle task 
 * hook.  The application is limited in size to allow its compilation using
 * the KickStart version of the IAR compiler.
 *
 * Six of the created co-routines are the standard 'co-routine flash' 
 * co-routines contained within the Demo/Common/Minimal/crflash.c file and 
 * documented on the FreeRTOS.org WEB site.  
 *
 * The 'LCD Task' waits on a message queue for messages informing it what and
 * where to display text.  This is the only task that accesses the LCD
 * so mutual exclusion is guaranteed.
 *
 * The 'LCD Message Task' periodically sends strings to the LCD Task using
 * the message queue.  The strings are rotated to form a short message and
 * are written to the top row of the LCD.
 *
 * The 'ADC Co-routine' periodically reads the ADC input that is connected to
 * the light sensor, forms a short message from the value, and then sends this
 * message to the LCD Task using the same message queue.  The ADC readings are
 * displayed on the bottom row of the LCD.  
 *
 * The eighth co-routine and final task control the transmission and reception
 * of a string to UART 0.  The co-routine periodically sends the first 
 * character of the string to the UART, with the UART's TxEnd interrupt being
 * used to transmit the remaining characters.  The UART's RxEnd interrupt 
 * receives the characters and places them on a queue to be processed by the 
 * 'COMs Rx' task.  An error is latched should an unexpected character be 
 * received, or any character be received out of sequence.  
 *
 * A loopback connector is required to ensure that each character transmitted 
 * on the UART is also received on the same UART.  For test purposes the UART
 * FIFO's are not utalised in order to maximise the interrupt overhead.  Also
 * a pseudo random interval is used between the start of each transmission in 
 * order that the resultant interrupts are more randomly distributed and 
 * therefore more likely to highlight any problems.
 *
 * The flash co-routines control LED's zero to four.  LED five is toggled each
 * time the string is transmitted on the UART.  LED six is toggled each time
 * the string is CORRECTLY received on the UART.  LED seven is latched on 
 * should an error be detected in any task or co-routine.
 *
 * In addition the idle task makes repetitive calls to 
 * vSetAndCheckRegisters().  This simply loads the general purpose registers 
 * with a known value, then checks each register to ensure the held value is 
 * still correct.  As a low priority task this checking routine is likely to 
 * get repeatedly swapped in and out.  A register being found to contain an 
 * incorrect value is therefore indicative of an error in the task switching 
 * mechanism.
