 *  @brief      SD driver interface
 *
 *  The SD header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/SD.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *
 *  The SD driver is designed to serve as an interface to perform basic
 *  transfers directly to the SD card.
 *
 *  ## Opening the driver #
 *
 *  @code
 *  SD_Handle handle;
 *
 *  handle = SD_open(index, NULL);
 *  if (handle == NULL) {
 *      System_printf("Error opening SD driver\n");
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  This module serves as the main interface for TI-RTOS applications. Its
 *  purpose is to redirect the module's APIs to specific peripheral
 *  implementations which are specified using a pointer to a
 *  SD_FxnTable.
 *
 *  The SD driver interface module is joined (at link time) to a
 *  NULL-terminated array of SD_Config data structures named *SD_config*.
 *  *SD_config* is implemented in the application with each entry being an
 *  instance of a SD peripheral. Each entry in *SD_config* contains a:
 *  - (SD_FxnTable *) to a set of functions that implement a SD peripheral
 *  - (uintptr_t) data object that is associated with the SD_FxnTable
 *  - (uintptr_t) hardware attributes that are associated to the SD_FxnTable
 *
 *  # Instrumentation #
 *
 *  The SD driver interface produces log statements if
 *  instrumentation is enabled.
 *
 *  Diagnostics Mask | Log details                   |
