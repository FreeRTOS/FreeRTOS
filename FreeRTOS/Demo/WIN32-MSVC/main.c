 * expect to get real time behaviour from the Win32 port or this demo
 * application.  It is provided as a convenient development and demonstration
 * test bed only.  This was tested using Windows XP on a dual core laptop.
 *
 * Windows will not be running the FreeRTOS simulator threads continuously, so 
 * the timing information in the FreeRTOS+Trace logs have no meaningful units.  
 * See the documentation page for the Windows simulator for an explanation of
