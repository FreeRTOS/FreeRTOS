/*
 *
 * vMain() is effectively the demo application entry point.  It is called by
 * the main() function generated by the Processor Expert application.  
 *
 * vMain() creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.
 * The WEB	documentation provides more details of the demo application tasks.
 *
 * Main.c also creates a task called "Check".  This only executes every three 
 * seconds but has the highest priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.  
 * Its main function is to check that all the other tasks are still operational.
 * Each task (other than the "flash" tasks) maintains a unique count that is 
 * incremented each time the task successfully completes its function.  Should 
 * any error occur within such a task the count is permanently halted.  The 
 * check task inspects the count of each task to ensure it has changed since
 * the last time the check task executed.  If all the count variables have 
 * changed all the tasks are still executing error free, and the check task
 * toggles the onboard LED.  Should any task contain an error at any time 
 * the LED toggle rate will change from 3 seconds to 500ms.
 *
 * This file also includes the functionality normally implemented within the 
 * standard demo application file integer.c.  Due to the limited memory 
 * available on the microcontroller the functionality has been included within
 * the idle task hook [vApplicationIdleHook()] - instead of within the usual
 * separate task.  See the documentation within integer.c for the rationale 
 * of the integer task functionality.
 *
 *
 * 
 * The demo applications included with other FreeRTOS ports make use of the
 * standard ComTest tasks.  These use a loopback connector to transmit and
 * receive RS232 characters between two tasks.  The test is important for two
 * reasons:
 *
 *	1) It tests the mechanism of context switching from within an application
 *	   ISR.
 *
 *	2) It generates some randomised timing.
 *
 * The demo board used to develop this port does not include an RS232 interface
 * so the ComTest tasks could not easily be included.  Instead these two tests
 * are created using a 'Button Push' task.  
 * 
 * The 'Button Push' task blocks on a queue, waiting for data to arrive.  A
 * simple interrupt routine connected to the PP0 input on the demo board places
 * data in the queue each time the PP0 button is pushed (this button is built 
 * onto the demo board).  As the 'Button Push' task is created with a 
 * relatively high priority it will unblock and want to execute as soon as data
 * arrives in the queue - resulting in a context switch within the PP0 input
 * ISR.  If the data retrieved from the queue is that expected the 'Button Push'
 * task toggles LED 5.  Therefore correct operation is indicated by the LED
 * toggling each time the PP0 button is pressed.
 *
 * This test is not as satisfactory as the ComTest method - but the simple 
 * nature of the port makes is just about adequate.
