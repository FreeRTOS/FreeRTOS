/*
 * Creates eight tasks, each of which loops continuously performing a
 * floating point calculation.
 *
 * All the tasks run at the idle priority and never block or yield.  This causes 
 * all eight tasks to time slice with the idle task.  Running at the idle priority 
 * means that these tasks will get pre-empted any time another task is ready to run
 * or a time slice occurs.  More often than not the pre-emption will occur mid 
 * calculation, creating a good test of the schedulers context switch mechanism - a 
 * calculation producing an unexpected result could be a symptom of a corruption in 
 * the context of a task.
 *
 * This file demonstrates the use of the task tag and traceTASK_SWITCHED_IN and
 * traceTASK_SWITCHED_OUT macros to save and restore the floating point context.
