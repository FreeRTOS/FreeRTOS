 * - Retransmission is disabled when #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit is 0.
 * After sending the PUBLISH, the library will wait indefinitely for a PUBACK.
 * - If #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit is greater than 0, then QoS 1 publishes
 * that do not receive a PUBACK within #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryMs will be
 * retransmitted, up to #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit times.
 *
 * Retransmission follows a truncated exponential backoff strategy. The constant
 * @ref IOT_MQTT_RETRY_MS_CEILING controls the maximum time between retransmissions.
 *
 * After #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit retransmissions are sent, the MQTT
 * library will wait @ref IOT_MQTT_RESPONSE_WAIT_MS before a final check
 * for a PUBACK. If no PUBACK was received within this time, the QoS 1 PUBLISH

 * - #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryMs is 2000
 * - #IotMqttPublishInfo_t.retryLimit is 20

 * - 2000 ms (2000 ms after previous transmission)
 * - 6000 ms (4000 ms after previous transmission)
 * - 14000 ms (8000 ms after previous transmission)
 * - 30000 ms (16000 ms after previous transmission)

 * - 122000 ms, 182000 ms, 242000 ms... (every 60000 ms until 20 transmissions have been sent)

 *
 * The MQTT library passes this struct to a registered callback whenever an
 * operation completes, a message is received on a topic filter, or an MQTT
 * connection is disconnected.
 *
 * The members of this struct are different based on the callback trigger. If the
 * callback function was triggered for completed operation, the `operation`
 * member is valid. Otherwise, if the callback was triggered because of a
 * server-to-client PUBLISH, the `message` member is valid. Finally, if the callback
 * was triggered because of a disconnect, the `disconnectReason` member is valid.
 *
 * For an incoming PUBLISH, the `message.pTopicFilter` parameter provides the
 * subscription topic filter that matched the topic name in the PUBLISH. Because
 * topic filters may use MQTT wildcards, the topic filter may be different from the
 * topic name. This pointer must be treated as read-only; the topic filter must not
 * be modified. Additionally, the topic filter may go out of scope as soon as the
 * callback function returns, so it must be copied if it is needed at a later time.
 *
 * @attention Any pointers in this callback parameter may be freed as soon as
 * the [callback function](@ref IotMqttCallbackInfo_t.function) returns.
 * Therefore, data must be copied if it is needed after the callback function
 * returns.
 * @attention The MQTT library may set strings that are not NULL-terminated.

     * PUBLISH messages. These form part of an <i>MQTT session</i>, which is identified by
     * the [client identifier](@ref IotMqttConnectInfo_t.pClientIdentifier).
     *
     * Setting this value to `true` establishes a <i>clean session</i>, which causes
     * the MQTT server to discard any previous session data for a client identifier.

     * value is `true`, #IotMqttConnectInfo_t.pPreviousSubscriptions and
     * #IotMqttConnectInfo_t.previousSubscriptionCount are ignored.
     *
     * Setting this value to `false` does one of the following:
     * - If no previous session exists, the MQTT server will create a new
     * <i>persistent session</i>. The server may maintain subscriptions and
     * unacknowledged PUBLISH messages after a client disconnects, to be restored
     * once the same client identifier reconnects.
     * - If a previous session exists, the MQTT server restores all of the session's
     * subscriptions for the client identifier and may immediately transmit any
     * unacknowledged PUBLISH packets to the client.
     *
     * When a client with a persistent session disconnects, the MQTT server
     * continues to maintain all subscriptions and unacknowledged PUBLISH messages.
     * The client must also remember the session subscriptions to restore them
     * upon reconnecting. #IotMqttConnectInfo_t.pPreviousSubscriptions and

 * @section mqtt_constants_initializers MQTT Initializers
 * @brief Provides default values for the data types of the MQTT library.
 *
 * @snippet this define_mqtt_initializers
 *
 * All user-facing data types of the MQTT library should be initialized using
 * one of the following.
 *
 * @warning Failing to initialize an MQTT data type with the appropriate initializer
 * may result in undefined behavior!
 * @note The initializers may change at any time in future versions, but their
 * names will remain the same.
 *
 * <b>Example</b>
 * @code{c}
 * IotMqttNetworkInfo_t networkInfo = IOT_MQTT_NETWORK_INFO_INITIALIZER;
 * IotMqttSerializer_t serializer = IOT_MQTT_SERIALIZER_INITIALIZER;
 * IotMqttConnectInfo_t connectInfo = IOT_MQTT_CONNECT_INFO_INITIALIZER;
 * IotMqttPublishInfo_t publishInfo = IOT_MQTT_PUBLISH_INFO_INITIALIZER;
 * IotMqttSubscription_t subscription = IOT_MQTT_SUBSCRIPTION_INITIALIZER;
 * IotMqttCallbackInfo_t callbackInfo = IOT_MQTT_CALLBACK_INFO_INITIALIZER;
 * IotMqttConnection_t connection = IOT_MQTT_CONNECTION_INITIALIZER;
 * IotMqttOperation_t operation = IOT_MQTT_OPERATION_INITIALIZER;
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section mqtt_constants_flags MQTT Function Flags
 * @brief Flags that modify the behavior of MQTT library functions.
 * - #IOT_MQTT_FLAG_WAITABLE <br>
 *   @copybrief IOT_MQTT_FLAG_WAITABLE
 * - #IOT_MQTT_FLAG_CLEANUP_ONLY <br>
 *   @copybrief IOT_MQTT_FLAG_CLEANUP_ONLY
 *
 * Flags should be bitwise-ORed with each other to change the behavior of
 * @ref mqtt_function_subscribeasync, @ref mqtt_function_unsubscribeasync,
 * @ref mqtt_function_publishasync, their blocking versions; or @ref mqtt_function_disconnect.
 *
 * @note The values of the flags may change at any time in future versions, but
 * their names will remain the same. Additionally, flags that may be used together
 * will be bitwise-exclusive of each other.
