 *
 * <b>Driver Description</b>
 *
 * The device driver enables higher layer software (e.g., an application) to
 * communicate to the XEmacPs. The driver handles transmission and reception
 * of Ethernet frames, as well as configuration and control. No pre or post
 * processing of frame data is performed. The driver does not validate the
 * contents of an incoming frame in addition to what has already occurred in
 * hardware.
 * A single device driver can support multiple devices even when those devices
 * have significantly different configurations.
 *
 * <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
 *
 * The XEmacPs_Config structure is used by the driver to configure itself.
 * This configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based
 * on hardware build properties.
 *
 * The driver instance can be initialized in
 *
 *   - XEmacPs_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, EffectiveAddress):  Uses a
 *     configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a system
 *     with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address
 *     replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.
 *
 * The device supports DMA only as current development plan. No FIFO mode is
 * supported. The driver expects to start the DMA channels and expects that
 * the user has set up the buffer descriptor lists.
 *
 * <b>Interrupts and Asynchronous Callbacks</b>
 *
 * The driver has no dependencies on the interrupt controller. When an
 * interrupt occurs, the handler will perform a small amount of
 * housekeeping work, determine the source of the interrupt, and call the
 * appropriate callback function. All callbacks are registered by the user
 * level application.
 *
 * <b>Virtual Memory</b>
 *
 * All virtual to physical memory mappings must occur prior to accessing the
 * driver API.
 *
 * For DMA transactions, user buffers supplied to the driver must be in terms
 * of their physical address.
 *
 * <b>DMA</b>
 *
 * The DMA engine uses buffer descriptors (BDs) to describe Ethernet frames.
 * These BDs are typically chained together into a list the hardware follows
 * when transferring data in and out of the packet buffers. Each BD describes
 * a memory region containing either a full or partial Ethernet packet.
 *
 * Interrupt coalescing is not suppoted from this built-in DMA engine.
 *
 * This API requires the user to understand how the DMA operates. The
 * following paragraphs provide some explanation, but the user is encouraged
 * to read documentation in xemacps_bdring.h as well as study example code
 * that accompanies this driver.
 *
 * The API is designed to get BDs to and from the DMA engine in the most
 * efficient means possible. The first step is to establish a  memory region
 * to contain all BDs for a specific channel. This is done with
 * XEmacPs_BdRingCreate(). This function sets up a BD ring that hardware will
 * follow as BDs are processed. The ring will consist of a user defined number
 * of BDs which will all be partially initialized. For example on the transmit
 * channel, the driver will initialize all BDs' so that they are configured
 * for transmit. The more fields that can be permanently setup at
 * initialization, then the fewer accesses will be needed to each BD while
 * the DMA engine is in operation resulting in better throughput and CPU
 * utilization. The best case initialization would require the user to set
 * only a frame buffer address and length prior to submitting the BD to the
 * engine.
 *
 * BDs move through the engine with the help of functions
 * XEmacPs_BdRingAlloc(), XEmacPs_BdRingToHw(), XEmacPs_BdRingFromHw(),
 * and XEmacPs_BdRingFree().
 * All these functions handle BDs that are in place. That is, there are no
 * copies of BDs kept anywhere and any BD the user interacts with is an actual
 * BD from the same ring hardware accesses.
 *
 * BDs in the ring go through a series of states as follows:
 *   1. Idle. The driver controls BDs in this state.
 *   2. The user has data to transfer. XEmacPs_BdRingAlloc() is called to
 *      reserve BD(s). Once allocated, the user may setup the BD(s) with
 *      frame buffer address, length, and other attributes. The user controls
 *      BDs in this state.
 *   3. The user submits BDs to the DMA engine with XEmacPs_BdRingToHw. BDs
 *      in this state are either waiting to be processed by hardware, are in
 *      process, or have been processed. The DMA engine controls BDs in this
 *      state.
 *   4. Processed BDs are retrieved with XEmacEpv_BdRingFromHw() by the
 *      user. Once retrieved, the user can examine each BD for the outcome of
 *      the DMA transfer. The user controls BDs in this state. After examining
 *      the BDs the user calls XEmacPs_BdRingFree() which places the BDs back
 *      into state 1.
 *
 * Each of the four BD accessor functions operate on a set of BDs. A set is
 * defined as a segment of the BD ring consisting of one or more BDs. The user
 * views the set as a pointer to the first BD along with the number of BDs for
 * that set. The set can be navigated by using macros XEmacPs_BdNext(). The
 * user must exercise extreme caution when changing BDs in a set as there is
 * nothing to prevent doing a mBdNext past the end of the set and modifying a
 * BD out of bounds.
 *
 * XEmacPs_BdRingAlloc() + XEmacPs_BdRingToHw(), as well as
 * XEmacPs_BdRingFromHw() + XEmacPs_BdRingFree() are designed to be used in
 * tandem. The same BD set retrieved with BdRingAlloc should be the same one
 * provided to hardware with BdRingToHw. Same goes with BdRingFromHw and
 * BdRIngFree.
 *
 * <b>Alignment & Data Cache Restrictions</b>
 *
 * Due to the design of the hardware, all RX buffers, BDs need to be 4-byte
 * aligned. Please reference xemacps_bd.h for cache related macros.
 *
 * DMA Tx:
 *
 *   - If frame buffers exist in cached memory, then they must be flushed
 *     prior to committing them to hardware.
 *
 * DMA Rx:
 *
 *   - If frame buffers exist in cached memory, then the cache must be
 *     invalidated for the memory region containing the frame prior to data
 *     access
 *
 * Both cache invalidate/flush are taken care of in driver code.
 *
 * <b>Buffer Copying</b>
 *
 * The driver is designed for a zero-copy buffer scheme. That is, the driver
 * will not copy buffers. This avoids potential throughput bottlenecks within
 * the driver. If byte copying is required, then the transfer will take longer
 * to complete.
 *
 * <b>Checksum Offloading</b>
 *
 * The Embedded Processor Block Ethernet can be configured to perform IP, TCP
 * and UDP checksum offloading in both receive and transmit directions.
 *
 * IP packets contain a 16-bit checksum field, which is the 16-bit 1s
 * complement of the 1s complement sum of all 16-bit words in the header.
 * TCP and UDP packets contain a 16-bit checksum field, which is the 16-bit
 * 1s complement of the 1s complement sum of all 16-bit words in the header,
 * the data and a conceptual pseudo header.
 *
 * To calculate these checksums in software requires each byte of the packet
 * to be read. For TCP and UDP this can use a large amount of processing power.
 * Offloading the checksum calculation to hardware can result in significant
 * performance improvements.
 *
 * The transmit checksum offload is only available to use DMA in packet buffer
 * mode. This is because the complete frame to be transmitted must be read
 * into the packet buffer memory before the checksum can be calculated and
 * written to the header at the beginning of the frame.
 *
 * For IP, TCP or UDP receive checksum offload to be useful, the operating
 * system containing the protocol stack must be aware that this offload is
 * available so that it can make use of the fact that the hardware has verified
 * the checksum.
 *
 * When receive checksum offloading is enabled in the hardware, the IP header
 * checksum is checked, where the packet meets the following criteria:
 *
 * 1. If present, the VLAN header must be four octets long and the CFI bit
 *    must not be set.
 * 2. Encapsulation must be RFC 894 Ethernet Type Encoding or RFC 1042 SNAP
 *    encoding.
 * 3. IP v4 packet.
 * 4. IP header is of a valid length.
 * 5. Good IP header checksum.
 * 6. No IP fragmentation.
 * 7. TCP or UDP packet.
 *
 * When an IP, TCP or UDP frame is received, the receive buffer descriptor
 * gives an indication if the hardware was able to verify the checksums.
 * There is also an indication if the frame had SNAP encapsulation. These
 * indication bits will replace the type ID match indication bits when the
 * receive checksum offload is enabled.
 *
 * If any of the checksums are verified incorrect by the hardware, the packet
 * is discarded and the appropriate statistics counter incremented.
 *
 * <b>PHY Interfaces</b>
 *
 * RGMII 1.3 is the only interface supported.
 *
 * <b>Asserts</b>
 *
 * Asserts are used within all Xilinx drivers to enforce constraints on
 * parameters. Asserts can be turned off on a system-wide basis by defining,
 * at compile time, the NDEBUG identifier. By default, asserts are turned on
 * and it is recommended that users leave asserts on during development. For
 * deployment use -DNDEBUG compiler switch to remove assert code.
 *
 * @note
 *
 * Xilinx drivers are typically composed of two parts, one is the driver
 * and the other is the adapter.  The driver is independent of OS and processor
 * and is intended to be highly portable.  The adapter is OS-specific and
 * facilitates communication between the driver and an OS.
 * This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. Any needs for
 * dynamic memory management, threads or thread mutual exclusion, or cache
 * control must be satisfied bythe layer above this driver.

 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- -------------------------------------------------------
 * 1.00a wsy  01/10/10 First release
 * 1.00a asa  11/21/11 The function XEmacPs_BdRingFromHwTx in file
 *		       xemacps_bdring.c is modified. Earlier it was checking for
 *		       "BdLimit"(passed argument) number of BDs for finding out
 *		       which BDs are successfully processed. Now one more check
 *		       is added. It looks for BDs till the current BD pointer
 *		       reaches HwTail. By doing this processing time is saved.
 * 1.00a asa  01/24/12 The function XEmacPs_BdRingFromHwTx in file
 *		       xemacps_bdring.c is modified. Now start of packet is
 *		       searched for returning the number of BDs processed.
 * 1.02a asa  11/05/12 Added a new API for deleting an entry from the HASH
 *		       registers. Added a new API to set the bust length.
 *		       Added some new hash-defines.
 * 1.03a asa  01/23/12 Fix for CR #692702 which updates error handling for
 *		       Rx errors. Under heavy Rx traffic, there will be a large
 *		       number of errors related to receive buffer not available.
 *		       Because of a HW bug (SI #692601), under such heavy errors,
 *		       the Rx data path can become unresponsive. To reduce the
 *		       probabilities for hitting this HW bug, the SW writes to
 *		       bit 18 to flush a packet from Rx DPRAM immediately. The
 *		       changes for it are done in the function
 *		       XEmacPs_IntrHandler.
 * 1.05a asa  09/23/13 Cache operations on BDs are not required and hence
 *		       removed. It is expected that all BDs are allocated in
 *		       from uncached area.
 * 1.06a asa  11/02/13 Changed the value for XEMACPS_RXBUF_LEN_MASK from 0x3fff
 *				to 0x1fff. This fixes the CR#744902.

 *                    1000BASE-X mode export proper values to the xparameters.h
 *                    file. Changes are made in the driver tcl file.
 * 3.0   adk  08/1/15  Don't include gem in peripheral test when gem is
 *                    configured with PCS/PMA Core. Changes are made in the
 *		       test app tcl(CR:827686).
 * 3.0   kvn  02/13/15 Modified code for MISRA-C:2012 compliance.

 *                     examples to ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed"
 *                     strings are available in all examples. This is a fix
 *                     for CR-965028.
 *       ms   03/17/17 Modified text file in examples folder for doxygen
 *                     generation.
