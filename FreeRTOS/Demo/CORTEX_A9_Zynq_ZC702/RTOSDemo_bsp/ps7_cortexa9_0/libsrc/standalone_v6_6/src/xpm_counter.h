 *
 * Cortex A9 event counter functions can be utilized to configure and control
 * the Cortex-A9 performance monitor events.
 *
 * Cortex-A9 performance monitor has six event counters which can be used to
 * count a variety of events described in Coretx-A9 TRM. xpm_counter.h defines
 * configurations XPM_CNTRCFGx which can be used to program the event counters
 * to count a set of events.
 *
 * @note
 * It doesn't handle the Cortex-A9 cycle counter, as the cycle counter is
 * being used for time keeping.
