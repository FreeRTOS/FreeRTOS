/*
 * main-blinky.c is included when the "Blinky" build configuration is used.
 * main-full.c is included when the "Full" build configuration is used.
 *
 * main-full.c (this file) defines a comprehensive demo that creates many
 * tasks, queues, semaphores and timers.  It also demonstrates how Cortex-M3
 * interrupts can interact with FreeRTOS tasks/timers, a simple web server, and
 * run time statistics gathering functionality.  ***IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A
 * SIMPLER STARTING POINT THEN USE THE "BLINKY" BUILD CONFIGURATION FIRST.***
 *
 * If the Ethernet functionality is excluded, then this demo will run 'stand
 * alone' (without the rest of the tower system) on the TWR-K60N512 tower
 * module.  If the Ethernet functionality is included, then the full Freescale
 * K60 tower kit, including both the TWR-K60N512 and TWR-SER modules, is
 * required (as the Ethernet connector is on the TWR-SER).  The TWR-K60N512 is
 * populated with a K60N512 Cortex-M4 microcontroller.
 *
 * The main() Function:
 * main() creates four demo specific software timers, and one demo specific
 * task (the web server task).  It also creates a whole host of 'standard
 * demo' tasks/queues/semaphores/timers, before starting the scheduler.  The
 * demo specific tasks and timers are described in the comments here.  The
 * standard demo tasks are described on the FreeRTOS.org web site.
 *
 * The standard demo tasks provide no specific functionality.  They are
 * included to both test the FreeRTOS port, and provide examples of how the
 * various FreeRTOS API functions can be used.
 *
 * This demo creates 37 persistent tasks, then dynamically creates and destroys
 * another two tasks as the demo executes.
 *
 *
 * The Demo Specific "LED" Timers and Callback Function:
 * Two very simple LED timers are created.  All they do is toggle an LED each
 * when the timer callback function is executed.  The two timers share a
 * callback function, so the callback function parameter is used to determine
 * which timer actually expired, and therefore, which LED to toggle.  Both
 * timers use a different frequency, one toggles the blue LED and the other the
 * green LED.
 *
 * The LED/Button Software Timer and the Button Interrupt:
 * The user button SW2 is configured to generate an interrupt each time it is
 * pressed.  The interrupt service routine switches the orange/yellow LED on,
 * and resets the LED software timer.  The LED timer has a 5000 millisecond (5
 * second) period, and uses a callback function that is defined to just turn the
 * LED off again.  Therefore, pressing the user button will turn the LED on, and
 * the LED will remain on until a full five seconds pass without the button
 * being pressed.
 *
 * The Demo Specific "Check" Timer and Callback Function:
 * The check timer period is initially set to three seconds.  The check timer
 * callback function checks that all the standard demo tasks are not only still
 * executing, but are executing without reporting any errors.  If the check
 * timer discovers that a task has either stalled, or reported an error, then it
 * changes its own period from the initial three seconds, to just 200ms.  The
 * check timer callback function also toggles the orange/red LED each time it is
 * called.  This provides a visual indication of the system status:  If the LED
 * toggles every three seconds, then no issues have been discovered.  If the LED
 * toggles every 200ms, then an issue has been discovered with at least one
 * task.  The last reported issue is latched into the pcStatusMessage variable,
 * and displayed at the bottom of the "task stats" web page served by the
 * embedded web server task.
 *
 * The web server task:
 * The web server task implements a simple embedded web server that includes
 * CGI scripting.  Pages are provided that allow task statistics, network
 * statistics and run time statistics to be viewed.  In addition, an IO page is
 * served that allows the orange/yellow LED to be turned on and off.  Finally,
 * a page is included that serves a large jpg file.  See the documentation page
 * for this demo on the http://www.FreeRTOS.org web site for web server
 * configuration and usage instructions.
 *
 * The Demo Specific Idle Hook Function:
 * The idle hook function demonstrates how to query the amount of FreeRTOS heap
 * space that is remaining (see vApplicationIdleHook() defined in this file).
 *
 * The Demo Specific Tick Hook Function:
 * The tick hook function is used to test the interrupt safe software timer
 * functionality.
