 * @{
 * @details
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of the XQspiPs driver. It supports only
 * master mode. User documentation for the driver functions is contained in this
 * file in the form of comment blocks at the front of each function.
 *
 * A QSPI device connects to an QSPI bus through a 4-wire serial interface.
 * The QSPI bus is a full-duplex, synchronous bus that facilitates communication
 * between one master and one slave. The device is always full-duplex,
 * which means that for every byte sent, one is received, and vice-versa.
 * The master controls the clock, so it can regulate when it wants to
 * send or receive data. The slave is under control of the master, it must
 * respond quickly since it has no control of the clock and must send/receive
 * data as fast or as slow as the master does.
 *
 * <b> Linear Mode </b>
 * The Linear Quad-SPI Controller extends the existing Quad-SPI Controllerï¿½s
 * functionality by adding a linear addressing scheme that allows the SPI flash
 * memory subsystem to behave like a typical ROM device.  The new feature hides
 * the normal SPI protocol from a master reading from the SPI flash memory. The
 * feature improves both the user friendliness and the overall read memory
 * throughput over that of the current Quad-SPI Controller by lessening the
 * amount of software overheads required and by the use of the faster AXI
 * interface.
 *
 * <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
 *
 * The XQspiPs_Config structure is used by the driver to configure itself. This
 * configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based on HW
 * build properties.
 *
 * To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed by
 * various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized in the
 * following way:
 *	- XQspiPs_LookupConfig(DeviceId) - Use the device identifier to find
 *	  static configuration structure defined in xqspips_g.c. This is setup
 *	  by the tools. For some operating systems the config structure will be
 *	  initialized by the software and this call is not needed.
 *	- XQspiPs_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, EffectiveAddr) - Uses a
 *	  configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a system
 *	  with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address
 *	  replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.
 *
 * <b>Multiple Masters</b>
 *
 * More than one master can exist, but arbitration is the responsibility of
 * the higher layer software. The device driver does not perform any type of
 * arbitration.
 *
 * <b>Modes of Operation</b>
 *
 * There are four modes to perform a data transfer and the selection of a mode
 * is based on Chip Select(CS) and Start. These two options individually, can
 * be controlled either by software(Manual) or hardware(Auto).
 * - Auto CS: Chip select is automatically asserted as soon as the first word
 *	     is written into the TXFIFO and de asserted when the TXFIFO becomes
 *	     empty
 * - Manual CS: Software must assert and de assert CS.
 * - Auto Start: Data transmission starts as soon as there is data in the
 *		TXFIFO and stalls when the TXFIFO is empty
 * - Manual Start: Software must start data transmission at the beginning of
 *		  the transaction or whenever the TXFIFO has become empty
 *
 * The preferred combination is Manual CS and Auto Start.
 * In this combination, the software asserts CS before loading any data into
 * TXFIFO. In Auto Start mode, whenever data is in TXFIFO, controller sends it
 * out until TXFIFO becomes empty. The software reads the RXFIFO whenever the
 * data is available. If no further data, software disables CS.
 *
 * Risks/challenges of other combinations:
 * - Manual CS and Manual Start: Manual Start bit should be set after each
 *   TXFIFO write otherwise there could be a race condition where the TXFIFO
 *   becomes empty before the new word is written. In that case the
 *   transmission stops.
 * - Auto CS with Manual or Auto Start: It is very difficult for software to
 *   keep the TXFIFO filled. Whenever the TXFIFO runs empty, CS is de asserted.
 *   This results in a single transaction to be split into multiple pieces each
 *   with its own chip select. This will result in garbage data to be sent.
 *
 * <b>Interrupts</b>
 *
 * The user must connect the interrupt handler of the driver,
 * XQspiPs_InterruptHandler, to an interrupt system such that it will be
 * called when an interrupt occurs. This function does not save and restore
 * the processor context such that the user must provide this processing.
 *
 * The driver handles the following interrupts:
 * - Data Transmit Register/FIFO Underflow
 * - Data Receive Register/FIFO Not Empty
 * - Data Transmit Register/FIFO Overwater
 * - Data Receive Register/FIFO Overrun
 *
 * The Data Transmit Register/FIFO Overwater interrupt -- indicates that the
 * QSPI device has transmitted the data available to transmit, and now its data
 * register and FIFO is ready to accept more data. The driver uses this
 * interrupt to indicate progress while sending data.  The driver may have
 * more data to send, in which case the data transmit register and FIFO is
 * filled for subsequent transmission. When this interrupt arrives and all
 * the data has been sent, the driver invokes the status callback with a
 * value of XST_SPI_TRANSFER_DONE to inform the upper layer software that
 * all data has been sent.
 *
 * The Data Transmit Register/FIFO Underflow interrupt -- indicates that,
 * as slave, the QSPI device was required to transmit but there was no data
 * available to transmit in the transmit register (or FIFO). This may not
 * be an error if the master is not expecting data. But in the case where
 * the master is expecting data, this serves as a notification of such a
 * condition. The driver reports this condition to the upper layer
 * software through the status handler.
 *
 * The Data Receive Register/FIFO Overrun interrupt -- indicates that the QSPI
 * device received data and subsequently dropped the data because the data
 * receive register and FIFO was full. The driver reports this condition to the
 * upper layer software through the status handler. This likely indicates a
 * problem with the higher layer protocol, or a problem with the slave
 * performance.
 *
 *
 * <b>Polled Operation</b>
 *
 * Transfer in polled mode is supported through a separate interface function
 * XQspiPs_PolledTransfer(). Unlike the transfer function in the interrupt mode,
 * this function blocks until all data has been sent/received.
 *
 * <b>Device Busy</b>
 *
 * Some operations are disallowed when the device is busy. The driver tracks
 * whether a device is busy. The device is considered busy when a data transfer
 * request is outstanding, and is considered not busy only when that transfer
 * completes (or is aborted with a mode fault error).
 *
 * <b>Device Configuration</b>
 *
 * The device can be configured in various ways during the FPGA implementation
 * process. Configuration parameters are stored in the xqspips_g.c file or
 * passed in via XQspiPs_CfgInitialize(). A table is defined where each entry
 * contains configuration information for an QSPI device, including the base
 * address for the device.
 *
 * <b>RTOS Independence</b>
 *
 * This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent.  It works with
 * physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads or
 * thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be satisfied
 * by the layer above this driver.
 *
 * NOTE: This driver was always tested with endianess set to little-endian.

 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who Date     Changes
 * ----- --- -------- -----------------------------------------------
 * 1.00a sdm 11/25/10 First release, based on the PS SPI driver...
 * 1.01a sdm 11/22/11 Added TCL file for generating QSPI parameters
 *		     in xparameters.h
 * 2.00a kka 07/25/12 Added a few register defines for CR 670297
 *           Removed code related to mode fault for CR 671468
 *		     The XQspiPs_SetSlaveSelect has been modified to remove
 *		     the argument of the slave select as the QSPI controller
 *		     only supports one slave.
 *           XQspiPs_GetSlaveSelect API has been removed
 *           Added a flag ShiftReadData to the instance structure
 *.		     and is used in the XQspiPs_GetReadData API.
 *		     The ShiftReadData Flag indicates whether the data
 *		     read from the Rx FIFO needs to be shifted
 *		     in cases where the data is less than 4  bytes
 *           Removed the selection for the following options:
 *		     Master mode (XQSPIPS_MASTER_OPTION) and
 *		     Flash interface mode (XQSPIPS_FLASH_MODE_OPTION) option
 *		     as the QSPI driver supports the Master mode
 *		     and Flash Interface mode and doesnot support
 *		     Slave mode or the legacy mode.
 *		     Modified the XQspiPs_PolledTransfer and XQspiPs_Transfer
 *		     APIs so that the last argument (IsInst) specifying whether
 *		     it is instruction or data has been removed. The first byte
 *		     in the SendBufPtr argument of these APIs specify the
 *		     instruction to be sent to the Flash Device.
 *		     This version of the driver fixes CRs 670197/663787/
 *		     670297/671468.
 *           Added the option for setting the Holdb_dr bit in the
 *		     configuration options, XQSPIPS_HOLD_B_DRIVE_OPTION
 *		     is the option to be used for setting this bit in the
 *		     configuration register.
 *		     The XQspiPs_PolledTransfer function has been updated
 *		     to fill the data to fifo depth.
 * 2.01a sg  02/03/13 Added flash opcodes for DUAL_IO_READ,QUAD_IO_READ.
 *		     Added macros for Set/Get Rx Watermark. Changed QSPI
 *		     Enable/Disable macro argument from BaseAddress to
 *		     Instance Pointer. Added DelayNss argument to SetDelays
 *		     and GetDelays API's.
 *		     Created macros XQspiPs_IsManualStart and
 *		     XQspiPs_IsManualChipSelect.
 *		     Changed QSPI transfer logic for polled and interrupt
 *		     modes to be based on filled tx fifo count and receive
 *		     based on it. RXNEMPTY interrupt is not used.
 *		     Added assertions to XQspiPs_LqspiRead function.
 *		     SetDelays and GetDelays API's include DelayNss parameter.
 *		     Added defines for DelayNss,Rx Watermark,Interrupts
 *		     which need write to clear. Removed Read zeros mask from
 *		     LQSPI Config register. Renamed Fixed burst error to
 *		     data FSM error in  LQSPI Status register.
 *
 * 2.02a hk  05/07/13 Added ConnectionMode to config structure.
 *			 Corresponds to C_QSPI_MODE - 0:Single, 1:Stacked, 2:Parallel
 *			 Added enable and disable to the XQspiPs_LqspiRead() function
 *			 Removed XQspi_Reset() in Set_Options() function when
 *			 LQSPI_MODE_OPTION is set.

 *            flag status register to the flash instruction table
 *            Handling for instructions not in flash instruction
 *			 table added. Checking for Tx FIFO empty when switching from
 *			 TXD1/2/3 to TXD0 added. If WRSR instruction is sent with
 *            byte count 3 (spansion), instruction size and TXD register
 *			 changed accordingly. CR# 712502 and 703869.
 *            Added prefix to constant definitions for ConnectionMode
 *            Added (#ifdef linear base address) in the Linear read function.
 *            Changed  XPAR_XQSPIPS_0_LINEAR_BASEADDR to
 *            XPAR_PS7_QSPI_LINEAR_0_S_AXI_BASEADDR in
 *            XQspiPs_LqspiRead function. Fix for CR#718141.
 *
 * 2.03a hk  09/17/13 Modified polled and interrupt transfers to make use of
 *                    thresholds. This is to improve performance.

 *                    CR#737760.
 * 3.1   hk  08/13/14 When writing to the configuration register, set/reset
 *                    required bits leaving reserved bits untouched. CR# 796813.
 * 3.2	sk	02/05/15 Add SLCR reset in abort function as a workaround because

/** @name Configuration options
 *
 * The following options are supported to enable/disable certain features of
 * an QSPI device.  Each of the options is a bit mask, so more than one may be
 * specified.
 *
 *
 * The <b>Active Low Clock option</b> configures the device's clock polarity.
 * Setting this option means the clock is active low and the SCK signal idles
 * high. By default, the clock is active high and SCK idles low.
 *
 * The <b>Clock Phase option</b> configures the QSPI device for one of two
 * transfer formats.  A clock phase of 0, the default, means data is valid on
 * the first SCK edge (rising or falling) after the slave select (SS) signal
 * has been asserted. A clock phase of 1 means data is valid on the second SCK
 * edge (rising or falling) after SS has been asserted.
 *
 *
 * The <b>QSPI Force Slave Select option</b> is used to enable manual control of
 * the slave select signal.
 * 0: The SPI_SS signal is controlled by the QSPI controller during
 * transfers. (Default)
 * 1: The SPI_SS signal is forced active (driven low) regardless of any
 * transfers in progress.
 *
 * NOTE: The driver will handle setting and clearing the Slave Select when
 * the user sets the "FORCE_SSELECT_OPTION". Using this option will allow the
 * QSPI clock to be set to a faster speed. If the QSPI clock is too fast, the
 * processor cannot empty and refill the FIFOs before the TX FIFO is empty
 * When the QSPI hardware is controlling the Slave Select signals, this
 * will cause slave to be de-selected and terminate the transfer.
 *
 * The <b>Manual Start option</b> is used to enable manual control of
 * the Start command to perform data transfer.
 * 0: The Start command is controlled by the QSPI controller during
 * transfers(Default). Data transmission starts as soon as there is data in
 * the TXFIFO and stalls when the TXFIFO is empty
 * 1: The Start command must be issued by software to perform data transfer.
 * Bit 15 of Configuration register is used to issue Start command. This bit
 * must be set whenever TXFIFO is filled with new data.
 *
 * NOTE: The driver will set the Manual Start Enable bit in Configuration
 * Register, if Manual Start option is selected. Software will issue
 * Manual Start command whenever TXFIFO is filled with data. When there is
 * no further data, driver will clear the Manual Start Enable bit.
