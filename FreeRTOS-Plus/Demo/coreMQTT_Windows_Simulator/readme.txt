The subdirectories of this directory contain multiple examples that demonstrate
coreMQTT using in both single and multi-threaded scenarios, as well as with
both plain text and authenticated and encrypted network interfaces.

The multi threaded example creates an MQTT agent (or daemon task).  It is thread
safe because only the agent task is allowed to access the coreMQTT API - hence
the API is only accessed from one FreeRTOS task.  Other tasks and interrupts
needing to interact with the MQTT agent do so through a thread safe queue.
We are generalising this technique for future coreMQTT releases, which will have
a re-usable agent component.

! Plain text examples are for ease of evaluation only - product devices should
! always use authenticated and encrypted communication.  Never send private or
! sensitive data on an unencrypted connection.
