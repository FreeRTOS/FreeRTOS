/*
 * This version of PollQ. c is for use on systems that have limited stack
 * space and no display facilities.  The complete version can be found in
 * the Demo/Common/Full directory.
 *
 * Creates two tasks that communicate over a single queue.  One task acts as a
 * producer, the other a consumer.
 *
 * The producer loops for three iteration, posting an incrementing number onto the
 * queue each cycle.  It then delays for a fixed period before doing exactly the
 * same again.
 *
 * The consumer loops emptying the queue.  Each item removed from the queue is
 * checked to ensure it contains the expected value.  When the queue is empty it
 * blocks for a fixed period, then does the same again.
 *
 * All queue access is performed without blocking.  The consumer completely empties
 * the queue each time it runs so the producer should never find the queue full.
 *
 * An error is flagged if the consumer obtains an unexpected value or the producer
 * find the queue is full.
