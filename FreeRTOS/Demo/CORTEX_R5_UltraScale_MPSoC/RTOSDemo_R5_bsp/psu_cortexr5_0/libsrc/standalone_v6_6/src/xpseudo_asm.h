 *
 * The xpseudo_asm.h includes xreg_cortexr5.h and xpseudo_asm_gcc.h.
 *
 * The xreg_cortexr5.h file contains definitions for inline assembler code.
 * It provides inline definitions for Cortex R5 GPRs, SPRs,co-processor
 * registers and Debug register
 *
 * The xpseudo_asm_gcc.h contains the definitions for the most often used
 * inline assembler instructions, available as macros. These can be very
 * useful for tasks such as setting or getting special purpose registers,
 * synchronization,or cache manipulation. These inline assembler instructions
 * can be used from drivers and user applications written in C.
