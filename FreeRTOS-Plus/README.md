## Directories:

+ The **FreeRTOS/Source** directory contains source code for some of the
  FreeRTOS+ components.  These subdirectories contain further readme files and
  links to documentation.

+ The **FreeRTOS/Demo** directory contains a demo application for every most of
  the FreeRTOS+ components.  Lots of the demo applications use the FreeRTOS
  Windows simulator for easy evaluation.  Be aware that FreeRTOS is much slower
  and not deterministic when executed in a simulated environment.

+ The **FreeRTOS/Test** directory contains tests for some of the FreeRTOS+
  components. These tests verify the functional correctness of FreeRTOS+ components.

+ The **FreeRTOS-Plus/VisualStudio_StaticProjects** directory contains configuration
  files and Visual Studio projects for FreeRTOS components and some third party
  libraries. These projects are used by the demo applications in the
  FreeRTOS-Plus/Demo directory.

+ The **FreeRTOS-Plus/ThirdParty** directory contains third party libraries used by
  the demo applications in the FreeRTOS-Plus/Demo directory.
