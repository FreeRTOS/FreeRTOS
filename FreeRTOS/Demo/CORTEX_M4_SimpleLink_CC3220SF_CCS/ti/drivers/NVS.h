 *
 *  @brief      <b>PRELIMINARY</b> Non-Volatile Storage Driver.
 *
 *  <b>WARNING</b> These APIs are <b>PRELIMINARY</b>, and subject to
 *  change in the next few months.
 *
 *  The NVS header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/NVS.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *
 *  The NVS module allows you to manage non-volatile memory.  Using the
 *  NVS APIs, you can read and write data to persistant storage.  Each NVS
 *  object manages a 'block' of non-volatile memory of a size specified in
 *  the NVS object's hardware attributes.  A 'page' will refer to the
 *  smallest unit of non-volatile storage that can be erased at one time,
 *  and the page size is the size of this unit.  This is hardware specific
 *  and may be meaningless for some persistant storage systems.  However,
 *  in the case of flash memory, page size should be taken into account
 *  when deciding the block size for NVS to manage.  For example on
 *  TM4C129x devices, a page size is 16KB.
 *
 *  When page size is relevant (e.g. for flash memory), the size of an
 *  NVS block size must be less than or equal to the page size.  The block
 *  size can be less than the page size, however, care must be taken not
 *  to use the area in the page outside of the block.  When the block is
 *  erased, the entire page will be erased, clearing anything in the page
 *  that was written outside of the block.
 *
 *  See the device specific NVS header file for configuration details.
