/*
 * The documentation page for this demo available on http://www.FreeRTOS.org
 * documents the hardware configuration required to run this demo.  It also
 * provides more information on the expected demo application behaviour.
 *
 * main() creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.
 * A lot of the created tasks are from the pool of "standard demo" tasks.  The
 * web documentation provides more details of the standard demo tasks, which
 * provide no particular functionality but do provide good examples of how to
 * use the FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks, interrupts and
 * tests are defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "LCD" task - The LCD task is a 'gatekeeper' task.  It is the only task that
 * is permitted to access the LCD and therefore ensures access to the LCD is
 * always serialised and there are no mutual exclusion issues.  When a task or
 * an interrupt wants to write to the LCD, it does not access the LCD directly
 * but instead sends the message to the LCD task.  The LCD task then performs
 * the actual LCD output.  This mechanism also allows interrupts to, in effect,
 * write to the LCD by sending messages to the LCD task.
 *
 * The LCD task is also a demonstration of a 'controller' task design pattern.
 * Some tasks do not actually send a string to the LCD task directly, but
 * instead send a command that is interpreted by the LCD task.  In a normal
 * application these commands can be control values or set points, in this
 * simple example the commands just result in messages being displayed on the
 * LCD.
 *
 * "Button Poll" task - This task polls the state of the 'up' key on the
 * joystick input device.  It uses the vTaskDelay() API function to control
 * the poll rate to ensure debouncing is not necessary and that the task does
 * not use all the available CPU processing time.
 *
 * Button Interrupt and run time stats display - The select button on the
 * joystick input device is configured to generate an external interrupt.  The
 * handler for this interrupt sends a message to LCD task, which interprets the
 * message to mean, firstly write a message to the LCD, and secondly, generate
 * a table of run time statistics.  The run time statistics are displayed as a
 * table that contains information on how much processing time each task has
 * been allocated since the application started to execute.  This information
 * is provided both as an absolute time, and as a percentage of the total run
 * time.  The information is displayed in the terminal IO window of the IAR
 * embedded workbench.  The online documentation for this demo shows a screen
 * shot demonstrating where the run time stats can be viewed.
 *
 * Idle Hook - The idle hook is a function that is called on each iteration of
 * the idle task.  In this case it is used to place the processor into a low
 * power mode.  Note however that this application is implemented using standard
 * components, and is therefore not optimised for low power operation.  Lower
 * power consumption would be achieved by converting polling tasks into event
 * driven tasks, and slowing the tick interrupt frequency.
 *
 * "Check" function called from the tick hook - The tick hook is called during
 * each tick interrupt.  It is called from an interrupt context so must execute
 * quickly, not attempt to block, and not call any FreeRTOS API functions that
 * do not end in "FromISR".  In this case the tick hook executes a 'check'
 * function.  This only executes every five seconds.  Its main function is to
 * check that all the standard demo tasks are still operational.  Each time it
 * executes it sends a status code to the LCD task.  The LCD task interprets the
 * code and displays an appropriate message - which will be PASS if no tasks
 * have reported any errors, or a message stating which task has reported an
 * error.
