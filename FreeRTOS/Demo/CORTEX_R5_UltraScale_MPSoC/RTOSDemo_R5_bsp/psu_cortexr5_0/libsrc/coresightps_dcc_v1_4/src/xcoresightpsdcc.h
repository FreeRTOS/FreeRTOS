 * CoreSight driver component.
 *
 * The coresight is a part of debug communication channel (DCC) group. Jtag UART
 * for ARM uses DCC. Each ARM core has its own DCC, so one need to select an
 * ARM target in XSDB console before running the jtag terminal command. Using the
 * coresight driver component, the output stream can be directed to a log file.
