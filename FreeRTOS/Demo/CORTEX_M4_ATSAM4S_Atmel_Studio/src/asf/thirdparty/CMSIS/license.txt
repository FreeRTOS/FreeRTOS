END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT FOR THE CORTEX MICROCONTROLLER SOFTWARE INTERFACE
STANDARD (CMSIS) SPECIFICATION AND SOFTWARE

THIS END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT ("LICENCE") IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (EITHER A
SINGLE INDIVIDUAL, OR SINGLE LEGAL ENTITY) AND ARM LIMITED ("ARM") FOR THE USE OF THE
CMSIS SPECIFICATION, EXAMPLE CODE, DSP LIBRARY SPECIFICATION AND DSP LIBRARY
IMPLEMENTATION AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED BELOW (COLLECTIVELY, THE "ARM
DELIVERABLES"). ARM IS ONLY WILLING TO LICENSE THE ARM DELIVERABLES TO YOU ON CONDITION
THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS IN THIS LICENCE. BY CLICKING "I AGREE", OR BY INSTALLING
OR OTHERWISE USING OR COPYING THE ARM DELIVERABLES YOU INDICATE THAT YOU AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY ALL THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS
LICENCE, ARM IS UNWILLING TO LICENSE YOU TO USE THE ARM DELIVERABLES AND YOU MAY NOT
INSTALL, USE OR COPY THE ARM DELIVERABLES.

"CMSIS Specification" means any documentation and C programming language files defining the application
programming interface, naming and coding conventions of the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface
Standard (CMSIS) as well as the System View Description (SVD) documentation and associated XML schema
file. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "CMSIS Specification" shall not include (i) the implementation of other
published specifications referenced in the CMSIS Specification; (ii) any enabling technologies that may be
necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the CMSIS Specification, but are not
themselves expressly set forth in the CMSIS Specification (e.g. compiler front ends, code generators, back ends,
libraries or other compiler, assembler or linker technologies; validation or debug software or hardware;
applications, operating system or driver software; RISC architecture; processor microarchitecture); (iii)
maskworks and physical layouts of integrated circuit designs; or (iv) RTL or other high level representations of
integrated circuit designs.

"DSP Library Implementation" means any C programming language source code implementing the functionality
of the digital signal processor (DSP) algorithms and the application programming interface as defined in the DSP
Library Specification. The DSP Library Implementation makes use of CMSIS application programming interface
and therefore is targeted at Cortex-M class processors.

"DSP Library Specification" means the DSP library documentation and C programming language file defining the
application programming interface of the DSP Library Implementation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "DSP
Library Specification" shall not include (i) the implementation of other published specifications referenced in the
DSP Library Specification; (ii) any enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or
portion thereof that complies with the DSP Library Specification, but are not themselves expressly set forth in the
DSP Library Specification (e.g. compiler front ends, code generators, back ends, libraries or other compiler,
assembler or linker technologies; validation or debug software or hardware; applications, operating system or
driver software; RISC architecture; processor microarchitecture); (iii) maskworks and physical layouts of
integrated circuit designs; or (iv) RTL or other high level representations of integrated circuit designs.

"Example Code" means any files in C, C++ or ARM assembly programming languages, associated project and
configuration files that demonstrate the usage of the CMSIS Specification, the DSP Library Specification and the
DSP Library Implementation, for microprocessors or device specific software applications that are for use with
microprocessors.
