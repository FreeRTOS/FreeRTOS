 *
 * The Xilinx Ethernet Lite (EmacLite) driver. This driver supports the Xilinx
 * Ethernet Lite 10/100 MAC (EmacLite).
 *
 * The Xilinx Ethernet Lite 10/100 MAC supports the following features:
 *   - Media Independent Interface (MII) for connection to external
 *     10/100 Mbps PHY transceivers
 *   - Independent internal transmit and receive buffers
 *   - CSMA/CD compliant operations for half-duplex modes
 *   - Unicast and broadcast
 *   - Automatic FCS insertion
 *   - Automatic pad insertion on transmit
 *   - Configurable ping/pong buffers for either/both transmit and receive
 *     buffer areas
 *   - Interrupt driven mode
 *   - Internal loop back
 *   - MDIO Support to access PHY Registers
 *
 * The Xilinx Ethernet Lite 10/100 MAC does not support the following features:
 *   - multi-frame buffering
 *     only 1 transmit frame is allowed into each transmit buffer,
 *     only 1 receive frame is allowed into each receive buffer.
 *     the hardware blocks reception until buffer is emptied
 *   - Pause frame (flow control) detection in full-duplex mode
 *   - Programmable inter frame gap
 *   - Multicast and promiscuous address filtering
 *   - Automatic source address insertion or overwrite
 *
 * <b>Driver Description</b>
 *
 * The device driver enables higher layer software (e.g., an application) to
 * communicate to the EmacLite. The driver handles transmission and reception
 * of Ethernet frames, as well as configuration of the controller. It does not
 * handle protocol stack functionality such as Link Layer Control (LLC) or the
 * Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). The protocol stack that makes use of the
 * driver handles this functionality. This implies that the driver is simply a
 * pass-through mechanism between a protocol stack and the EmacLite.
 *
 * Since the driver is a simple pass-through mechanism between a protocol stack
 * and the EmacLite, no assembly or disassembly of Ethernet frames is done at
 * the driver-level. This assumes that the protocol stack passes a correctly
 * formatted Ethernet frame to the driver for transmission, and that the driver
 * does not validate the contents of an incoming frame. A single device driver
 * can support multiple EmacLite devices.
 *
 * The driver supports interrupt driven mode and the default mode of operation
 * is polled mode. If interrupts are desired, XEmacLite_InterruptEnable() must
 * be called.
 *
 * <b>Device Configuration</b>
 *
 * The device can be configured in various ways during the FPGA implementation
 * process.  Configuration parameters are stored in the xemaclite_g.c file.
 * A table is defined where each entry contains configuration information for an
 * EmacLite device. This information includes such things as the base address
 * of the memory-mapped device and the number of buffers.
 *
 * <b>Interrupt Processing</b>
 *
 * After _Initialize is called, _InterruptEnable can be called to enable the
 * interrupt driven functionality. If polled operation is desired, just call
 * _Send and check the return code. If XST_FAILURE is returned, call _Send with
 * the same data until XST_SUCCESS is returned. The same idea applies to _Recv.
 * Call _Recv until the returned length is non-zero at which point the received
 * data is in the buffer provided in the function call.
 *
 * The Transmit and Receive interrupts are enabled within the _InterruptEnable
 * function and disabled in the _InterruptDisable function. The _Send and _Recv
 * functions acknowledge the EmacLite generated interrupts associated with each
 * function.
 * It is the application's responsibility to acknowledge any associated Interrupt
 * Controller interrupts if it is used in the system.
 *
 * <b>Memory Buffer Alignment</b>
 *
 * The alignment of the input/output buffers for the _Send and _Recv routine is
 * not required to be 32 bits. If the buffer is not aligned on a 32-bit boundary
 * there will be a performance impact while the driver aligns the data for
 * transmission or upon reception.
 *
 * For optimum performance, the user should provide a 32-bit aligned buffer
 * to the _Send and _Recv routines.
 *
 * <b>Asserts</b>
 *
 * Asserts are used within all Xilinx drivers to enforce constraints on argument
 * values. Asserts can be turned off on a system-wide basis by defining, at
 * compile time, the NDEBUG identifier.  By default, asserts are turned on and it
 * is recommended that application developers leave asserts on during
 * development.
 *
 * @note
 *
 * This driver requires EmacLite hardware version 1.01a and higher. It is not
 * compatible with earlier versions of the EmacLite hardware. Use version 1.00a
 * software driver for hardware version 1.00a/b.
 *
 * The RX hardware is enabled from powerup and there is no disable. It is
 * possible that frames have been received prior to the initialization
 * of the driver. If this situation is possible, call XEmacLite_FlushReceive()
 * to empty the receive buffers after initialization.
 *
 * This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent.  It works
 * with physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management,
 * threads or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must
 * be satisfied by the layer above this driver.

 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
 * 1.01a ecm  01/30/04 First release
 * 1.11a mta  03/21/07 Updated to new coding style
 * 1.12a mta  11/28/07 Added the function XEmacLite_CfgInitialize,
 *		      moved the functions XEmacLite_LookupConfig and
 *		      XEmacLite_Initialize to xemaclite_sinit.c for removing
 *		      the dependency on the static config table and
 *		      xparameters.h from the driver initialization
 * 1.13a sv   02/1/08  Updated the TxBufferAvailable routine to return
 *		      busy status properly and added macros for Tx/Rx status
 * 1.14a sdm  08/22/08 Removed support for static interrupt handlers from the MDD
 *		      file
 * 2.00a ktn  02/16/09 Added support for MDIO and internal loop back
 * 2.01a ktn  07/20/09 Updated the XEmacLite_AlignedWrite and
 *                     XEmacLite_AlignedRead functions to use volatile
 *                     variables so that they are not optimized.
 *                     Modified the XEmacLite_EnableInterrupts and
 *                     XEmacLite_DisableInterrupts functions to enable/disable
 *                     the interrupt in the Ping buffer as this is used to enable
 *                     the interrupts for both Ping and Pong Buffers.
 *                     The interrupt enable bit in the Pong buffer is not used by
 *                     the HW.
 *                     Modified XEmacLite_Send function to use Ping buffers
 *                     Interrupt enable bit since this alone is used to enable
 *                     the interrupts for both Ping and Pong Buffers.
 * 3.00a ktn  10/22/09 Updated driver to use the HAL Processor APIs/macros.
 *		      The macros have been renamed to remove _m from the name in
 *		      all the driver files.
 *		      The macros changed in this file are
 *		      XEmacLite_mNextTransmitAddr is XEmacLite_NextTransmitAddr,
 *		      XEmacLite_mNextReceiveAddr is XEmacLite_NextReceiveAddr,
 *		      XEmacLite_mIsMdioConfigured is XEmacLite_IsMdioConfigured,
 *		      XEmacLite_mIsLoopbackConfigured is
 *		      XEmacLite_IsLoopbackConfigured.
 *		      See xemaclite_i.h for the macros which have changed.
 * 3.01a ktn  07/08/10 The macro XEmacLite_GetReceiveDataLength in the
 *		      xemaclite.c file is changed to a static function.
 *		      XEmacLite_GetReceiveDataLength and XEmacLite_Recv
 *		      functions  are updated to support little endian
 *		      MicroBlaze.
 * 3.02a sdm  07/22/11 Removed redundant code in XEmacLite_Recv functions for
 *		      CR617290
 * 3.03a asa  04/05/12 Defined the flag __LITTLE_ENDIAN__ for cases where the
 *		      driver is compiled with ARM toolchain.
 * 3.04a srt  04/13/13 Removed warnings (CR 705000).
 * 4.0   adk  19/12/13 Updated as per the New Tcl API's
 * 4.1	nsk  07/13/15 Added Length check in XEmacLite_AlignedWrite function
 *		      in xemaclite_l.c file to avoid extra write operation
 *		      (CR 843707).
 * 4.2   sk   11/10/15 Used UINTPTR instead of u32 for Baseaddress CR# 867425.
 *                     Changed the prototype of XEmacLite_CfgInitialize API.
 * 4.2   adk  11/18/15 Fix compilation errors due to conflicting data types
