/*
 * This file contains the common functions for plain text, basic TLS, and mutual
 * authentication MQTT demos. Aside from the difference in security level during
 * connect, the three demos perform the same interaction with a MQTT broker. The
 * demos create a single application task that connects to a MQTT broker,
 * subscribes to a topic, publishes a topic with a message, and disconnect from a
 * MQTT broker. The task subscribes to the same topic it publishes to, receiving
 * the message it sends to the broker. Note that this demo does not terminate, the
 * connect-subscribe-publish-disconnect cycle is repeated for unlimited number of
 * times.
 *
 * The plain text MQTT demo does not authenticate the server nor the client. The
 * basic TLS MQTT demo builds on top of the plain text demo, adding broker
 * authentication and encryption. The mutual authentication MQTT demo builds on top
 * of the basic TLS demo, enabling both server and client authentication.
 *
 * For more information regarding the MQTT library and the demo, please refer to:
