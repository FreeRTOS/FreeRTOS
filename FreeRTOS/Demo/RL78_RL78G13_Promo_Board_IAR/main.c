/*
 *
 * ENSURE TO READ THE DOCUMENTATION PAGE FOR THIS PORT AND DEMO APPLICATION ON
 * THE http://www.FreeRTOS.org WEB SITE FOR FULL INFORMATION ON USING THIS DEMO
 * APPLICATION, AND ITS ASSOCIATE FreeRTOS ARCHITECTURE PORT!
 *
 *
 * main() creates the demo application tasks and timers, then starts the
 * scheduler.
 *
 * This demo is configured to run on the RL78/G13 Promotion Board, which is
 * fitted with a R5F100LEA microcontroller.  The R5F100LEA contains a little
 * under 4K bytes of usable internal RAM.  The RAM size restricts the number of
 * demo tasks that can be created, and the demo creates 13 tasks, 4 queues and
 * two timers.  The RL78 range does however include parts with up to 32K bytes
 * of RAM (at the time of writing).  Using FreeRTOS on such a part will allow an
 * application to make a more comprehensive use of FreeRTOS tasks, and other
 * FreeRTOS features.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks, tests and timers
 * are created within this file:
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill the registers with known values, then check
 * that each register still contains its expected value.  Each task uses a
 * different set of values.  The reg test tasks execute with a very low priority,
 * so get preempted very frequently.  A register containing an unexpected value
 * is indicative of an error in the context switching mechanism.
 *
 * The "Demo" Timer and Callback Function:
 * The demo timer callback function does nothing more than increment a variable.
 * The period of the demo timer is set relative to the period of the check timer
 * (described below).  This allows the check timer to know how many times the
 * demo timer callback function should execute between each execution of the
 * check timer callback function.  The variable incremented in the demo timer
 * callback function is used to determine how many times the callback function
 * has executed.
 *
 * The "Check" Timer and Callback Function:
 * The check timer period is initially set to three seconds.  The check timer
 * callback function checks that all the standard demo tasks, the reg test tasks,
 * and the demo timer are not only still executing, but are executing without
 * reporting any errors.  If the check timer discovers that a task or timer has
 * stalled, or reported an error, then it changes its own period from the
 * initial three seconds, to just 200ms.  The check timer callback function also
 * toggles the user LED each time it is called.  This provides a visual
 * indication of the system status:  If the LED toggles every three seconds,
 * then no issues have been discovered.  If the LED toggles every 200ms, then an
 * issue has been discovered with at least one task.
