/* ****************************************************************************
 * When configCREATE_LOW_POWER_DEMO is set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h main() will
 * call main_low_power(), which is defined in this file.  main_low_power()
 * demonstrates FreeRTOS tick suppression being used to allow the MCU to be
 * placed into the Retention low power mode.  When configCREATE_LOW_POWER_DEMO
 * is set to 0 main will instead call main_full(), which is a more comprehensive
 * RTOS demonstration.
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 * This application demonstrates the FreeRTOS tickless idle mode (tick
 * suppression).  See http://www.freertos.org/low-power-tickless-rtos.html
 * The demo is configured to execute on the SAM4L-EK.
 *
 * Functionality:
 *
 *  + Two tasks are created, an Rx task and a Tx task.
 *
 *  + The Rx task blocks on a queue to wait for data, blipping an LED each time
 *    data is received (turning it on and then off again) before returning to
 *    block on the queue once more.
 *
 *  + The Tx task repeatedly enters the Blocked state for 500ms.  On exiting the
 *    blocked state the Tx task sends a value through the queue to the Rx task
 *    (causing the Rx task to exit the blocked state and blip the LED).
 *
 *    Blocking for a finite period allows the kernel to stop the tick interrupt
 *    and place the SAM4L into Retention mode - the lowest power mode possible
 *    that allows the CPU registers and RAM to retain their state.
 *
 * Observed behaviour:
 *
 * For correct results the SAM4L-EK must be connected (and powered) using only
 * the JTAG USB connector, but the debugger must not be connected (the
 * application must be executed 'stand alone').
 *
 * The MCU spends most of its time in the Retention low power state, during
 * which times the current monitor (built onto the SAM4L-EK) will show a low
 * current reading.
 *
 * Every 500ms the MCU will come out of the low power state to turn the LED on,
 * then return to the low power state for 20ms before leaving the low power
 * state again to turn the LED off.  This will be observed as a fast blipping
 * on the LED, and two very brief dots appearing on the current monitor graph
 * (often observed as a single dot).
 *
 * The RTOS tick is suppressed while the MCU is in its low power state.
