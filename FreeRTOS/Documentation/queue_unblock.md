# xQueueUnblock Function

The `xQueueUnblock` function is used to unblock any thread waiting to receive or send from/to a queue. This function can be useful in scenarios where a thread needs to be interrupted due to specific events or conditions.

## Function Prototype

```c
BaseType_t xQueueUnblock(QueueHandle_t xQueue);
```

## Parameters

- `xQueue`: The handle of the queue on which the thread is waiting.

## Return Value

- `pdTRUE` if the function successfully unblocks a thread.
- `pdFALSE` if there are no threads waiting on the queue.

## Usage Example

Here is an example of how to use the `xQueueUnblock` function:

```c
#include "FreeRTOS.h"
#include "queue.h"
#include "task.h"

QueueHandle_t xQueue;

void vTask1(void *pvParameters)
{
    uint32_t ulValue;

    for (;;)
    {
        if (xQueueReceive(xQueue, &ulValue, portMAX_DELAY) == pdPASS)
        {
            // Process the received value
        }
    }
}

void vTask2(void *pvParameters)
{
    // Perform some operations

    // Unblock the task waiting on the queue
    xQueueUnblock(xQueue);
}

int main(void)
{
    xQueue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(uint32_t));

    if (xQueue != NULL)
    {
        xTaskCreate(vTask1, "Task 1", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, 1, NULL);
        xTaskCreate(vTask2, "Task 2", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, 1, NULL);

        vTaskStartScheduler();
    }

    for (;;);
}
```

In this example, `vTask1` waits indefinitely to receive a value from the queue. `vTask2` performs some operations and then calls `xQueueUnblock` to unblock `vTask1`.

## Notes

- The `xQueueUnblock` function can be used with any queue-based blocking operation in FreeRTOS.
- Ensure that the queue handle passed to `xQueueUnblock` is valid and properly initialized.
- This function does not guarantee that the unblocked thread will immediately resume execution. The scheduler will determine the next task to run based on priority and other factors.
