/*
 * Instead of the normal single demo application, the PIC18F demo is split
 * into several smaller programs of which this is the second.  This enables the
 * demo's to be executed on the RAM limited 40 pin devices.  The 64 and 80 pin
 * devices require a more costly development platform and are not so readily
 * available.
 *
 * The RTOSDemo2 project is configured for a PIC18F452 device.  Main2.c starts
 * 5 tasks (including the idle task).
 *
 * The first, second and third tasks do nothing but flash an LED.  This gives
 * visual feedback that everything is executing as expected.  One task flashes
 * an LED every 333ms (i.e. on and off every 333/2 ms), then next every 666ms
 * and the last every 999ms.
 *
 * The last task runs at the idle priority.  It repeatedly performs a 32bit
 * calculation and checks it's result against the expected value.  This checks
 * that the temporary storage utilised by the compiler to hold intermediate
 * results does not get corrupted when the task gets switched in and out.
 * should the calculation ever provide an incorrect result the final LED is
 * turned on.
 *
 * On entry to main() an 'X' is transmitted.  Monitoring the serial port using a
 * dumb terminal allows for verification that the device is not continuously
 * being reset (no more than one 'X' should be transmitted).
 *
 * http://www.FreeRTOS.org contains important information on the use of the
 * PIC18F port.
