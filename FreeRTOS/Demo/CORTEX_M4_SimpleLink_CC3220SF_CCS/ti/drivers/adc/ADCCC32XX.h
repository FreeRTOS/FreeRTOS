 *  @brief      ADC driver implementation for the ADC peripheral on CC32XX
 *
 *  This ADC driver implementation is designed to operate on a CC32XX ADC
 *  peripheral.  The ADCCC32XX header file should be included in an application
 *  as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/ADC.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/ADCCC32XX.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref ADC.h for a complete description of APIs & example of use.
