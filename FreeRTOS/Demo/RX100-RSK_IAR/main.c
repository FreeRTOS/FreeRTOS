 * This project provides two demo applications.  A low power project that
 * demonstrates the FreeRTOS tickless mode, and a more comprehensive test and
 * demo application.  The configCREATE_LOW_POWER_DEMO setting (defined at the
 * top of FreeRTOSConfig.h) is used to select between the two.  The low power
 * demo is implemented and described in main_low_power.c.  The more
 * comprehensive test and demo application is implemented and described in
 * main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.
