 * The FreeRTOS Cortex-A port implements a full interrupt nesting model.
 *
 * Interrupts that are assigned a priority at or below
 * configMAX_API_CALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY (which counter-intuitively in the ARM
 * generic interrupt controller [GIC] means a priority that has a numerical
 * value above configMAX_API_CALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY) can call FreeRTOS safe API
 * functions and will nest.
 *
 * Interrupts that are assigned a priority above
 * configMAX_API_CALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY (which in the GIC means a numerical
 * value below configMAX_API_CALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY) cannot call any FreeRTOS
 * API functions, will nest, and will not be masked by FreeRTOS critical
 * sections (although it is necessary for interrupts to be globally disabled
 * extremely briefly as the interrupt mask is updated in the GIC).
 *
 * FreeRTOS functions that can be called from an interrupt are those that end in
 * "FromISR".  FreeRTOS maintains a separate interrupt safe API to enable
 * interrupt entry to be shorter, faster, simpler and smaller.
 *
 * The Zynq implements 256 unique interrupt priorities.  For the purpose of
 * setting configMAX_API_CALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY 255 represents the lowest
 * priority.
