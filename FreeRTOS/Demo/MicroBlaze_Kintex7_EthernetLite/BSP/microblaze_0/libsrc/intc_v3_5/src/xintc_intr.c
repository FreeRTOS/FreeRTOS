 *
 * This file contains the interrupt processing for the XIntc component which
 * is the driver for the Xilinx Interrupt Controller.  The interrupt
 * processing is partitioned seperately such that users are not required to
 * use the provided interrupt processing.  This file requires other files of
 * the driver to be linked in also.
 *
 * Two different interrupt handlers are provided for this driver such that the
 * user must select the appropriate handler for the application.  The first
 * interrupt handler, XIntc_VoidInterruptHandler, is provided for systems
 * which use only a single interrupt controller or for systems that cannot
 * otherwise provide an argument to the XIntc interrupt handler (e.g., the RTOS
 * interrupt vector handler may not provide such a facility).  The constant
 * XPAR_INTC_SINGLE_DEVICE_ID must be defined for this handler to be included in
 * the driver.  The second interrupt handler, XIntc_InterruptHandler, uses an
 * input argument which is an instance pointer to an interrupt controller driver
 * such that multiple interrupt controllers can be supported.  This handler
 * requires the calling function to pass it the appropriate argument, so another
 * level of indirection may be required.
 *
 * Note that both of these handlers are now only provided for backward
 * compatibility. The handler defined in xintc_l.c is the recommended handler.
 *
 * The interrupt processing may be used by connecting one of the interrupt
 * handlers to the interrupt system.  These handlers do not save and restore
 * the processor context but only handle the processing of the Interrupt
 * Controller.  The two handlers are provided as working examples. The user is
 * encouraged to supply their own interrupt handler when performance tuning is
 * deemed necessary.

 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- ---------------------------------------------------------
 * 1.00b jhl  02/13/02 First release
 * 1.00c rpm  10/17/03 New release. Support the static vector table created
 *                     in the xintc_g.c configuration table. Collapse handlers
 *                     to use the XIntc_DeviceInterruptHandler() in xintc_l.c.
 * 1.00c rpm  04/09/04 Added conditional compilation around the old handler
 *                     XIntc_VoidInterruptHandler(). This handler will only be
 *                     include/compiled if XPAR_INTC_SINGLE_DEVICE_ID is defined.
 * 1.10c mta  03/21/07 Updated to new coding style
 * 2.00a ktn  10/20/09 Updated to use HAL Processor APIs.
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * This driver assumes that the context of the processor has been saved prior to
 * the calling of the Interrupt Controller interrupt handler and then restored
 * after the handler returns. This requires either the running RTOS to save the
 * state of the machine or that a wrapper be used as the destination of the
 * interrupt vector to save the state of the processor and restore the state
 * after the interrupt handler returns.
