 *  The Power header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/Power.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *  The Power manager facilitates the transition of the MCU from active state
 *  to one of the sleep states and vice versa.  It provides drivers the
 *  ability to set and release dependencies on hardware resources and keeps
 *  a reference count on each resource to know when to enable or disable the
 *  peripheral clock to the resource.  It provides drivers the ability to
 *  register a callback function upon a specific power event.  In addition,
 *  drivers and apps can set or release constraints to prevent the MCU from
 *  transitioning into a particular sleep state.

 *  @brief  Register a function to be called upon a specific power event
 *
 *  This function registers a function to be called when a Power event occurs.
 *  Registrations and the corresponding notifications are processed in
 *  first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. The function registered must behave as
 *  described later, below.
 *
 *  The pNotifyObj parameter is a pointer to a pre-allocated, opaque object
 *  that will be used by Power to support the notification.  This object could
 *  be dynamically allocated, or declared as a global object. This function
 *  will properly initialized the object's fields as appropriate; the caller
 *  just needs to provide a pointer to this pre-existing object.
 *
 *  The eventTypes parameter identifies the type of power event(s) for which
 *  the notify function being registered is to be called. (Event identifiers are
 *  device specific, and defined in the device-specific Power include file.
 *  For example, the events for MSP432 are defined in PowerMSP432.h.)  The
 *  eventTypes parameter for this function call is treated as a bitmask, so
 *  multiple event types can be registered at once, using a common callback
 *  function.  For example, to call the specified notifyFxn when both
 *  the entering deepsleep and awake from deepsleep events occur, eventTypes
 *  should be specified as: PowerMSP432_ENTERING_DEEPSLEEP |
 *  PowerMSP432_AWAKE_DEEPSLEEP
 *
 *  The notifyFxn parameter specifies a callback function to be called when the
 *  specified Power event occurs. The notifyFxn must implement the following
 *  signature:
 *       status = notifyFxn(eventType, eventArg, clientArg);
 *
 *  Where: eventType identifies the event being signalled, eventArg is an
 *  optional event-specific argument, and clientArg is an abitrary argument
 *  specified by the client at registration.  Note that multipe types of events
 *  can be specified when registering the notification callback function,
 *  but when the callback function is actually called by Power, only a
 *  single eventType will be specified for the callback (i.e., the current
 *  event).  The status returned by the client notification function must
 *  be one of the following constants: Power_NOTIFYDONE if the client processed
 *  the notification successfully, or Power_NOTIFYERROR if an error occurred
 *  during notification.
 *
 *  The clientArg parameter is an arbitrary, client-defined argument to be
 *  passed back to the client upon notification. This argument may allow one
 *  notify function to be used by multiple instances of a driver (that is, the
 *  clientArg can be used to identify the instance of the driver that is being
 *  notified).
 *
 *  @param  pNotifyObj      notification object (preallocated by caller)

 *
 *  This function releases a constraint that was previously declared with

 *  manager to once again allow transitions to sleep.
 *
 *  Constraint identifiers are device specific, and defined in the

 *

 *  then Power will activate the peripheral during this function call.
 *
 *  What is needed to make a peripheral resource 'active' will vary by device
 *  family. For some devices this may be a simple enable of a clock to the
 *  specified peripheral.  For others it may also require a power on of a
 *  power domain.  In either case, the Power manager will take care of these
 *  details, and will also implement reference counting for resources and their
 *  interdependencies.  For example, if multiple UART peripherals reside in
 *  a shared serial power domain, the Power manager will power up the serial
 *  domain when it is first needed, and then automatically power the domain off
 *  later, when all related dependencies for the relevant peripherals are
 *  released.

 *
 *  This function manages a transition to a new device performance level.
 *  Before the actual transition is initiated, notifications will be sent to
 *  any clients who've registered (with Power_registerNotify()) for a
 *  'start change performance level' notification.  The event name is device
 *  specific, and defined in the device-specific Power include file.  For
 *  example, for MSP432, the event is "PowerMSP432_START_CHANGE_PERF_LEVEL",
