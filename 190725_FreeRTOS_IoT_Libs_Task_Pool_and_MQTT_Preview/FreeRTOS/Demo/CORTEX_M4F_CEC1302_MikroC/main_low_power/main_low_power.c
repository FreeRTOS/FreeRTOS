/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky demo
 * that demonstrates tickless low power operation, and a more comprehensive
 * test and demo application.  The configCREATE_LOW_POWER_DEMO setting in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h is used to select between the two.  See the notes on using
 * configCREATE_LOW_POWER_DEMO in main.c.  This file implements the low power
 * version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * low power demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and
 * functions required to configure the hardware are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_low_power() creates one queue, and two tasks.  It then starts the
 * scheduler.
 *
 * The Queue Send Task:
 * The queue send task is implemented by the prvQueueSendTask() function in
 * this file.  It sends the value 100 to the queue every second.
 *
 * The Queue Receive Task:
 * The queue receive task is implemented by the prvQueueReceiveTask() function
 * in this file.  prvQueueReceiveTask() blocks on the queue, blipping (quickly
 * turn on then off again) the LED each time it received the value 100 from the
 * queue send task.  The queue send task writes to the queue every second, so
 * the LED will blip once a second.
 *
 * The RTOS tick is turned off when the queue send task and queue receive task
 * are both in the Blocked state.
