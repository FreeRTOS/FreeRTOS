 *
 *  @brief      I2C driver interface
 *
 *  The I2C driver interface provides device independent APIs, data types,
 *  and macros. The I2C header file should be included in an application as
 *  follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/I2C.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Overview #
 *  This section assumes that you have background knowledge and understanding
 *  about how the I2C protocol operates. For the full I2C specifications and
 *  user manual (UM10204), see the NXP Semiconductors website.
 *
 *  The I2C driver has been designed to operate as a single I2C master by
 *  performing I2C transactions between the target and I2C slave peripherals.
 *  The I2C driver does not support I2C slave mode.
 *  I2C is a communication protocol - the specifications define how data
 *  transactions are to occur via the I2C bus. The specifications do not
 *  define how data is to be formatted or handled, allowing for flexible
 *  implementations across different peripheral vendors. As a result, the
 *  I2C handles only the exchange of data (or transactions) between master
 *  and slaves. It is the left to the application to interpret and
 *  manipulate the contents of each specific I2C peripheral.
 *
 *  The I2C driver has been designed to operate in an RTOS environment.  It
 *  protects its transactions with OS primitives supplied by the underlying
 *  RTOS.
 *
 *  # Usage #
 *
 *  The I2C driver includes the following APIs:
 *    - I2C_init(): Initialize the I2C driver.
 *    - I2C_Params_init():  Initialize an #I2C_Params structure with default
 *      vaules.
 *    - I2C_open():  Open an instance of the I2C driver.
 *    - I2C_control():  Performs implemenation-specific features on a given
 *      I2C peripheral.
 *    - I2C_transfer():  Transfer the data.
 *    - I2C_close():  De-initialize the I2C instance.
 *
 *
 *  ### I2C Driver Configuration #
 *
 *  In order to use the I2C APIs, the application is required
 *  to provide device-specific I2C configuration in the Board.c file.
 *  The I2C driver interface defines a configuration data structure:
 *
 *  @code
 *  typedef struct I2C_Config_ {
 *      I2C_FxnTable  const    *fxnTablePtr;
 *      void                   *object;
 *      void          const    *hwAttrs;
 *  } I2C_Config;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The application must declare an array of I2C_Config elements, named
 *  I2C_config[].  Each element of I2C_config[] must be populated with
 *  pointers to a device specific I2C driver implementation's function
 *  table, driver object, and hardware attributes.  The hardware attributes
 *  define properties such as the I2C peripheral's base address and
 *  pins.  Each element in I2C_config[] corresponds to
 *  an I2C instance, and none of the elements should have NULL pointers.
 *  There is no correlation between the index and the
 *  peripheral designation (such as I2C0 or I2C1).  For example, it is
 *  possible to use I2C_config[0] for I2C1.
 *
 *  Because the I2C configuration is very device dependent, you will need to
 *  check the doxygen for the device specific I2C implementation.  There you
 *  will find a description of the I2C hardware attributes.  Please also
 *  refer to the Board.c file of any of your examples to see the I2C
 *  configuration.
 *
 *  ### Initializing the I2C Driver #
 *
 *  I2C_init() must be called before any other I2C APIs.  This function
 *  iterates through the elements of the I2C_config[] array, calling
 *  the element's device implementation I2C initialization function.
 *
 *  ### I2C Parameters
 *
 *  The #I2C_Params structure is passed to the I2C_open() call.  If NULL
 *  is passed for the parameters, I2C_open() uses default parameters.
 *  An #I2C_Params structure is initialized with default values by passing
 *  it to I2C_Params_init().
 *  Some of the I2C parameters are described below.  To see brief descriptions
 *  of all the parameters, see #I2C_Params.
 *
 *  #### I2C Transfer Mode
 *  The I2C driver supports two transfer modes of operation: blocking and
 *  callback:
 *  - #I2C_MODE_BLOCKING: The call to I2C_transfer() blocks until the
 *    transfer completes.
 *  - #I2C_MODE_CALLBACK: The call to I2C_transfer() returns immediately.
 *    When the transfer completes, the I2C driver will call a user-
 *    specified callback function.
 *
 *  The transfer mode is determined by the #I2C_Params.transferMode parameter
 *  passed to I2C_open().  The I2C driver defaults to blocking mode, if the
 *  application does not set it.
 *
 *  In blocking mode, a task calling I2C_transfer() is blocked until the
 *  transaction completes.  Other tasks requesting I2C transactions while
 *  a transaction is currently taking place, are also placed into a
 *  blocked state.
 *
 *  In callback mode, an I2C_transfer() functions asynchronously, which
 *  means that it does not block a calling task's execution.  In this
 *  mode, the user must set #I2C_Params.transferCallbackFxn to a user-
 *  provided callback function. After an I2C transaction has completed,
 *  the I2C driver calls the user- provided callback function.
 *  If another I2C transaction is requested, the transaction is queued up.
 *  As each transfer completes, the I2C driver will call the user-specified
 *  callback function.  The user callback will be called from either hardware
 *  or software interrupt context, depending upon the device implementation.
 *
 *  Once an I2C driver instance is opened, the
 *  only way to change the transfer mode is to close and re-open the I2C
 *  instance with the new transfer mode.
 *
 *  #### Specifying an I2C Bus Frequency
 *  The I2C controller's bus frequency is determined by #I2C_Params.bitRate
 *  passed to I2C_open().  The standard I2C bus frequencies are 100 kHz and
 *  400 kHz, with 100 kHz being the default.
 *
 *  ### Opening the I2C Driver #
 *  After initializing the I2C driver by calling I2C_init(), the application
 *  can open an I2C instance by calling I2C_open().  This function
 *  takes an index into the I2C_config[] array and an I2C parameters data
 *  structure.   The I2C instance is specified by the index of the I2C in
 *  I2C_config[].  Only one I2C index can be used at a time;
 *  calling I2C_open() a second time with the same index previosly
 *  passed to I2C_open() will result in an error.  You can,
 *  though, re-use the index if the instance is closed via I2C_close().
 *
 *  If no I2C_Params structure is passed to I2C_open(), default values are
 *  used. If the open call is successful, it returns a non-NULL value.
 *
 *  Example opening an I2C driver instance in blocking mode:
 *  @code
 *  I2C_Handle i2c;
 *
 *  // NULL params are used, so default to blocking mode, 100 KHz
 *  i2c = I2C_open(Board_I2C0, NULL);
 *
 *  if (!i2c) {
 *      // Error opening the I2C
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Example opening an I2C driver instance in callback mode and 400KHz bit rate:
 *
 *  @code
 *  I2C_Handle i2c;
 *  I2C_Params params;
 *
 *  I2C_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.transferMode  = I2C_MODE_CALLBACK;
 *  params.transferCallbackFxn = myCallbackFunction;
 *  params.bitRate  = I2C_400kHz;
 *
 *  handle = I2C_open(Board_I2C0, &params);
 *  if (!i2c) {
 *      // Error opening I2C
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ### Transferring data #
 *  An I2C transaction with an I2C peripheral is started by calling
 *  I2C_transfer().  Three types of transactions are supported: Write, Read,
 *  or Write/Read. Each transfer is completed before another transfer is
 *  initiated.
 *
 *  For Write/Read transactions, the specified data is first written to the
 *  peripheral, then a repeated start is sent by the driver, which initiates
 *  the read operation.  This type of transfer is useful if an I2C peripheral
 *  has a pointer register that needs to be adjusted prior to reading from
 *  the referenced data register.
 *
 *  The details of each transaction are specified with an #I2C_Transaction data
 *  structure. This structure defines the slave I2C address, pointers
 *  to write and read buffers, and their associated byte counts. If
 *  no data needs to be written or read, the corresponding byte counts should
 *  be set to zero.
 *
 *  If an I2C transaction is requested while a transaction is currently
 *  taking place, the new transaction is placed onto a queue to be processed
 *  in the order in which it was received.
 *
 *  The below example shows sending three bytes of data to a slave peripheral
 *  at address 0x50, in blocking mode:
 *
 *  @code
 *  unsigned char writeBuffer[3];
 *  I2C_Transaction i2cTransaction;
 *
 *  i2cTransaction.slaveAddress = 0x50;
 *  i2cTransaction.writeBuf = writeBuffer;
 *  i2cTransaction.writeCount = 3;
 *  i2cTransaction.readBuf = NULL;
 *  i2cTransaction.readCount = 0;
 *
 *  status = I2C_transfer(i2c, &i2cTransaction);
 *  if (!status) {
 *      // Unsuccessful I2C transfer
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The next example shows reading of five bytes of data from the I2C
 *  peripheral, also in blocking mode:
 *
 *  @code
 *  unsigned char readBuffer[5];
 *  I2C_Transaction i2cTransaction;
 *
 *  i2cTransaction.slaveAddress = 0x50;
 *  i2cTransaction.writeBuf = NULL;
 *  i2cTransaction.writeCount = 0;
 *  i2cTransaction.readBuf = readBuffer;
 *  i2cTransaction.readCount = 5;
 *
 *  status = I2C_transfer(i2c, &i2cTransaction);
 *  if (!status) {
 *      // Unsuccessful I2C transfer
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  This example shows writing of two bytes and reading of four bytes in a
 *  single transaction.
 *
 *  @code
 *  unsigned char readBuffer[4];
 *  unsigned char writeBuffer[2];
 *  I2C_Transaction i2cTransaction;
 *
 *  i2cTransaction.slaveAddress = 0x50;
 *  i2cTransaction.writeBuf = writeBuffer;
 *  i2cTransaction.writeCount = 2;
 *  i2cTransaction.readBuf = readBuffer;
 *  i2cTransaction.readCount = 4;
 *
 *  status = I2C_transfer(i2c, &i2cTransaction);
 *  if (!status) {
 *      // Unsuccessful I2C transfer
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  This final example shows usage of asynchronous callback mode, with queuing
 *  of multiple transactions.  Because multiple transactions are simultaneously
 *  queued, separate I2C_Transaction structures must be used.  (This is a
 *  general rule, that I2C_Transaction structures cannot be reused until
 *  it is known that the previous transaction has completed.)
 *
 *  First, for the callback function (that is specified in the I2C_open() call)
 *  the "arg" in the I2C_Transaction structure is a SemaphoreP_Handle; when
 *  this value is non-NULL, SemaphoreP_post() is called in the callback using
 *  the specified handle, to signal completion to the task that queued the
 *   transactions:
 *
 *  @code
 *  Void callbackFxn(I2C_Handle handle, I2C_Transaction *msg, Bool transfer) {
 *      if (msg->arg != NULL) {
 *          SemaphoreP_post((SemaphoreP_Handle)(msg->arg));
 *      }
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Snippets of the task code that initiates the transactions are shown below.
 *  Note the use of multiple I2C_Transaction structures, and passing of the
 *  handle of the semaphore to be posted via i2cTransaction2.arg.
 *  I2C_transfer() is called three times to initiate each transaction.
 *  Since callback mode is used, these functions return immediately.  After
 *  the transactions have been queued, other work can be done, and then
 *  eventually SemaphoreP_pend() is called to wait for the last I2C
 *  transaction to complete.  Once the callback posts the semaphore, the task
 *  will be moved to the ready state, so the task can resume execution, after
 *  the SemaphoreP_pend() call.
 *
 *  @code
 *  Void taskfxn(arg0, arg1) {
 *
 *      I2C_Transaction i2cTransaction0;
 *      I2C_Transaction i2cTransaction1;
 *      I2C_Transaction i2cTransaction2;
 *
 *      ...
 *      i2cTransaction0.arg = NULL;
 *      i2cTransaction1.arg = NULL;
 *      i2cTransaction2.arg = semaphoreHandle;
 *
 *      ...
 *      I2C_transfer(i2c, &i2cTransaction0);
 *      I2C_transfer(i2c, &i2cTransaction1);
 *      I2C_transfer(i2c, &i2cTransaction2);
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      SemaphoreP_pend(semaphoreHandle);
 *
 *      ...
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  This top-level I2C module serves as the main interface for RTOS
 *  applications. Its purpose is to redirect the module's APIs to specific
 *  peripheral implementations which are specified using a pointer to an
 *  #I2C_FxnTable.
 *
 *  The I2C driver interface module is joined (at link time) to an
 *  array of I2C_Config data structures named *I2C_config*.
 *  *I2C_config* is typically defined in the Board.c file used for the
 *  application.  If there are multiple instances of I2C peripherals on the
 *  device, there will typically be multiple I2C_Config structures defined in
 *  the board file. Each entry in *I2C_config* contains a:
 *  - (I2C_FxnTable *) to a set of functions that implement a I2C peripheral
 *  - (void *) data object that is associated with the I2C_FxnTable
 *  - (void *) hardware attributes that are associated to the I2C_FxnTable

 *  @brief  Perform an I2C transaction with an I2C slave peripheral.
 *
 *  This function will perform an I2C transfer, as specified by an
 *  I2C_Transaction structure.
 *
 *  An I2C transaction may write data to a peripheral, or read data from a
 *  peripheral, or both write and read data, in a single transaction.  If there
 *  is any data to be written, it will always be sent before any data is read
 *  from the peripheral.
 *
 *  The data written to the peripheral is preceded with the peripheral's 7-bit
 *  I2C slave address (with the Write bit set).
 *  After all the data has been transmitted, the driver will evaluate if any
 *  data needs to be read from the device.
 *  If yes, another START bit is sent, along with the same 7-bit I2C slave
 *  address (with the Read bit).  After the specified number of bytes have been
 *  read, the transfer is ended with a NACK and a STOP bit.  Otherwise, if
 *  no data is to be read, the transfer is concluded with a STOP bit.
 *
 *  In I2C_MODE_BLOCKING, I2C_transfer() will block thread execution until the
 *  transaction completes. Therefore, this function must only be called from an
 *  appropriate thread context (e.g., Task context for the TI-RTOS kernel).
 *
 *  In I2C_MODE_CALLBACK, the I2C_transfer() call does not block thread
 *  execution. Instead, a callback function (specified during I2C_open(), via
 *  the transferCallbackFxn field in the I2C_Params structure) is called when
 *  the transfer completes. Success or failure of the transaction is reported
 *  via the callback function's bool argument. If a transfer is already in
 *  progress, the new transaction is put on an internal queue. The driver
 *  services the queue in a first come first served basis.
 *
 *  @param  handle      An I2C_Handle
 *
 *  @param  transaction A pointer to an I2C_Transaction. All of the fields
 *                      within the transaction structure should be considered
 *                      write only, unless otherwise noted in the driver
 *                      implementation.
 *
 *  @note The I2C_Transaction structure must persist unmodified until the
 *  corresponding call to I2C_transfer() has completed.
 *
 *  @return In I2C_MODE_BLOCKING: true for a successful transfer; false for an
 *          error (for example, an I2C bus fault (NACK)).
 *
 *          In I2C_MODE_CALLBACK: always true. The transferCallbackFxn's bool
 *          argument will be true to indicate success, and false to indicate
 *          an error.
