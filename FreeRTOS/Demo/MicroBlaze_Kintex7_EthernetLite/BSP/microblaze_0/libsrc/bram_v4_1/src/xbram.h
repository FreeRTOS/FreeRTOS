 *
 * If ECC is not enabled, this driver exists only to allow the tools to
 * create a memory test application and to populate xparameters.h with memory
 * range constants. In this case there is no source code.
 *
 * If ECC is enabled, this file contains the software API definition of the
 * Xilinx BRAM Interface Controller (XBram) device driver.
 *
 * The Xilinx BRAM controller is a soft IP core designed for Xilinx
 * FPGAs and contains the following general features:
 *   - LMB v2.0 bus interfaces with byte enable support
 *   - Used in conjunction with bram_block peripheral to provide fast BRAM
 *     memory solution for MicroBlaze ILMB and DLMB ports
 *   - Supports byte, half-word, and word transfers
 *   - Supports optional BRAM error correction and detection.
 *
 * The driver provides interrupt management functions. Implementation of
 * interrupt handlers is left to the user. Refer to the provided interrupt
 * example in the examples directory for details.
 *
 * This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. Any needs for
 * dynamic memory management, threads or thread mutual exclusion, virtual
 * memory, or cache control must be satisfied by the layer above this driver.
 *
 * <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
 *
 * The XBram_Config structure is used by the driver to configure
 * itself. This configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain
 * based on HW build properties.
 *
 * To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed
 * by various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized as
 * follows:
 *
 *   - XBram_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, EffectiveAddr) -
 *     Uses a configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a
 *     system with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address
 *     replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.
 *
 * @note
 *
 * This API utilizes 32 bit I/O to the BRAM registers. With less
 * than 32 bits, the unused bits from registers are read as zero and written as
 * don't cares.
 *
 * <pre>
 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
 * 3.00a sa  05/11/10 Added ECC support
 * 3.01a sa  01/13/12  Changed Selftest API from
 *		      XBram_SelfTest(XBram *InstancePtr) to
 *		      XBram_SelfTest(XBram *InstancePtr, u8 IntMask) and
 *		      fixed a problem with interrupt generation for CR 639274
 *		      Modified Selftest example to return XST_SUCCESS when
 *		      ECC is not enabled and return XST_FAILURE when ECC is
 *		      enabled and Control Base Address is zero (CR 636581)
 *		      Modified Selftest to use correct CorrectableCounterBits
 *		      for CR 635655
 *		      Updated to check CorrectableFailingDataRegs in the case
 *		      of LMB BRAM.
 *            Added CorrectableFailingDataRegs and
 *		      UncorrectableFailingDataRegs to the config structure to
 *		      distinguish between AXI BRAM and LMB BRAM.
 *		      These registers are not present in the current version of
 *		      the AXI BRAM Controller.
 * 3.02a sa 04/16/12   Added test of byte and halfword read-modify-write
 * 3.02a sa 04/16/12   Modified driver tcl to sort the address parameters
 *                    to support both xps and vivado designs.
 * 3.02a adk 24/4/13   Modified the tcl file to avoid warnings
 *	              when ecc is disabled cr:705002.
 * 3.03a bss 05/22/13  Added Xil_DCacheFlushRange in xbram_selftest.c to
 *		      flush the Cache after writing to BRAM in InjectErrors
 *		      API(CR #719011)
 * 4.0   adk  19/12/13 Updated as per the New Tcl API's
 * 4.1   sk   11/10/15 Used UINTPTR instead of u32 for Baseaddress CR# 867425.
 *                     Changed the prototype of XBram_CfgInitialize API.
