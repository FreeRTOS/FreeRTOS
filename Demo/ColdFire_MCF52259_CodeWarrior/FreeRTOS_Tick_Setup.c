/*
 * FreeRTOS.org requires two interrupts - a tick interrupt generated from a
 * timer source, and a spare interrupt vector used for context switching.
 * The configuration below uses PIT0 for the former, and vector 16 for the
 * latter.  **IF YOUR APPLICATION HAS BOTH OF THESE INTERRUPTS FREE THEN YOU DO
 * NOT NEED TO CHANGE ANY OF THIS CODE** - otherwise instructions are provided
 * here for using alternative interrupt sources.
 *
 * To change the tick interrupt source:
 *
 *	1) Modify vApplicationSetupInterrupts() below to be correct for whichever
 *	peripheral is to be used to generate the tick interrupt.  The name of the
 *  handler function (currently vPIT0InterruptHandler()) should also be updated
 *  to indicate which peripheral is generating the interrupt.
 *
 *	2) Make sure the interrupt source is cleared within the interrupt handler function.
 *  Currently vPIT0InterruptHandler() clears the PIT0 interrupt.
 *
 *  3) Update the vector table within mcf5225x_vectors.s to install the tick
 *  interrupt handler in the correct vector position.
 *
 * To change the spare interrupt source:
 *
 *  1) Modify vApplicationSetupInterrupts() below to be correct for whichever
 *  interrupt vector is to be used.  Make sure you use a spare interrupt on interrupt
 *  controller 0, otherwise the register used to request context switches will also
 *  require modification.
 *
 *  2) Change the definition of configYIELD_INTERRUPT_VECTOR within FreeRTOSConfig.h
 *  to be correct for your chosen interrupt vector.
 *
 *  3) Update the vector table within mcf5225x_vectors.s to install the handler
 *  _vPortYieldISR() in the correct vector position (by default vector number 16 is
 *  used).
