/* 
 * This demo application creates seven co-routines and one task (two including 
 * the idle task).  The co-routines execute as part of the idle task hook.
 *
 * Five of the created co-routines are the standard 'co-routine flash' 
 * co-routines contained within the Demo/Common/Minimal/crflash.c file and 
 * documented on the FreeRTOS.org WEB site.  
 *
 * The 'LCD Task' rotates a string on the LCD, delaying between each character
 * as necessitated by the slow interface, and delaying between each string just
 * long enough to enable the text to be read.
 *
 * The sixth co-routine controls the transmission of a string to UART 0.  The 
 * co-routine periodically sends the first character of the string to the UART, 
 * with the UART's TxEnd interrupt being used to transmit the remaining 
 * characters.  The UART's RxEnd interrupt receives the characters and places 
 * them on a queue to be processed by the seventh and final co-routine.  An 
 * error is latched should an unexpected character be received, or any 
 * character be received out of sequence.  
 *
 * A loopback connector is required to ensure that each character transmitted 
 * on the UART is also received on the same UART.  For test purposes the UART
 * FIFO's are not utalised in order to maximise the interrupt overhead.  Also
 * a pseudo random interval is used between the start of each transmission in 
 * order that the resultant interrupts are more randomly distributed and 
 * therefore more likely to highlight any problems.
 *
 * The flash co-routines control LED's zero to four.  LED five is toggled each
 * time the string is transmitted on the UART.  LED six is toggled each time
 * the string is CORRECTLY received on the UART.  LED seven is latched on should
 * an error be detected in any task or co-routine.
 *
 * In addition the idle task makes repetative calls to 
 * prvSetAndCheckRegisters().  This simply loads the general purpose registers 
 * with a known value, then checks each register to ensure the held value is 
 * still correct.  As a low priority task this checking routine is likely to 
 * get repeatedly swapped in and out.  A register being found to contain an 
 * incorrect value is therefore indicative of an error in the task switching 
 * mechansim.
