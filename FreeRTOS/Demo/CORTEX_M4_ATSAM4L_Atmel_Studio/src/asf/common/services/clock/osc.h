/**
 * \ingroup clk_group
 * \defgroup osc_group Oscillator Management
 *
 * This group contains functions and definitions related to configuring
 * and enabling/disabling on-chip oscillators. Internal RC-oscillators,
 * external crystal oscillators and external clock generators are
 * supported by this module. What all of these have in common is that
 * they swing at a fixed, nominal frequency which is normally not
 * adjustable.
 *
 * \par Example: Enabling an oscillator
 *
 * The following example demonstrates how to enable the external
 * oscillator on XMEGA A and wait for it to be ready to use. The
 * oscillator identifiers are platform-specific, so while the same
 * procedure is used on all platforms, the parameter to osc_enable()
 * will be different from device to device.
 * \code
	osc_enable(OSC_ID_XOSC);
	osc_wait_ready(OSC_ID_XOSC); \endcode
 *
 * \section osc_group_board Board-specific Definitions
 * If external oscillators are used, the board code must provide the
 * following definitions for each of those:
 *   - \b BOARD_<osc name>_HZ: The nominal frequency of the oscillator.
 *   - \b BOARD_<osc name>_STARTUP_US: The startup time of the
 *     oscillator in microseconds.
 *   - \b BOARD_<osc name>_TYPE: The type of oscillator connected, i.e.
 *     whether it's a crystal or external clock, and sometimes what kind
 *     of crystal it is. The meaning of this value is platform-specific.
