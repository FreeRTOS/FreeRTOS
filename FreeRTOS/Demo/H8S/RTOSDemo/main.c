/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the demo application tasks.
 *
 * Main.c also creates a task called "Check".  This only executes every three
 * seconds but has the highest priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.
 * Its main function is to check that all the other tasks are still operational.
 * Each task (other than the "flash" tasks) maintains a unique count that is
 * incremented each time the task successfully completes its function.  Should
 * any error occur within such a task the count is permanently halted.  The
 * check task inspects the count of each task to ensure it has changed since
 * the last time the check task executed.  If all the count variables have
 * changed all the tasks are still executing error free, and the check task
 * toggles the onboard LED.  Should any task contain an error at any time
 * the LED toggle rate will change from 3 seconds to 500ms.
 *
 * To check the operation of the memory allocator the check task also
 * dynamically creates a task before delaying, and deletes it again when it
 * wakes.  If memory cannot be allocated for the new task the call to xTaskCreate
 * will fail and an error is signalled.  The dynamically created task itself
 * allocates and frees memory just to give the allocator a bit more exercise.
