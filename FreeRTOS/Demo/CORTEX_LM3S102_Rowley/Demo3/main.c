/*
 * This is a mini co-routine demo for the Rowley CrossFire LM3S102 development
 * board.  It makes use of the boards tri-colour LED and analogue input.
 *
 * Four co-routines are created - an 'I2C' co-routine and three 'flash'
 * co-routines.
 *
 * The I2C co-routine triggers an ADC conversion then blocks on a queue to 
 * wait for the conversion result - which it receives on the queue directly
 * from the I2C interrupt service routine.  The conversion result is then
 * scalled to a delay period.  The I2C interrupt then wakes each of the 
 * flash co-routines before itself delaying for the calculated period and
 * then repeating the whole process.
 *
 * When woken by the I2C co-routine the flash co-routines each block for 
 * a given period, illuminate an LED for a fixed period, then go back to
 * sleep to wait for the next cycle.  The uxIndex parameter of the flash
 * co-routines is used to ensure that each flashes a different LED, and that
 * the delay periods are such that the LED's get flashed in sequence.
