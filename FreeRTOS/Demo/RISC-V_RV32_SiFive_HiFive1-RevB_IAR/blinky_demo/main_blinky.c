/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky
 * style project, and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the simply blinky style version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * basic demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_blinky() creates one queue, and two tasks.  It then starts the
 * scheduler.
 *
 * The Queue Send Task:
 * The queue send task is implemented by the prvQueueSendTask() function in
 * this file.  prvQueueSendTask() sits in a loop that causes it to repeatedly
 * block for 1000 milliseconds, before sending the value 100 to the queue that
 * was created within main_blinky().  Once the value is sent, the task loops
 * back around to block for another 1000 milliseconds...and so on.
 *
 * The Queue Receive Task:
 * The queue receive task is implemented by the prvQueueReceiveTask() function
 * in this file.  prvQueueReceiveTask() sits in a loop where it repeatedly
 * blocks on attempts to read data from the queue that was created within
 * main_blinky().  When data is received, the task checks the value of the
 * data, and if the value equals the expected 100, writes 'Blink' to the UART
 * (the UART is used in place of the LED to allow easy execution in QEMU).  The
 * 'block time' parameter passed to the queue receive function specifies that
 * the task should be held in the Blocked state indefinitely to wait for data to
 * be available on the queue.  The queue receive task will only leave the
 * Blocked state when the queue send task writes to the queue.  As the queue
 * send task writes to the queue every 1000 milliseconds, the queue receive
 * task leaves the Blocked state every 1000 milliseconds, and therefore toggles
 * the LED every 200 milliseconds.
