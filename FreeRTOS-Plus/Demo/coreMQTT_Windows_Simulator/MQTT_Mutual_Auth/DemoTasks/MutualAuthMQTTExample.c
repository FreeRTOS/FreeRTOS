/*
 * Demo for showing use of the MQTT API using a mutually authenticated
 * network connection.
 *
 * The Example shown below uses MQTT APIs to create MQTT messages and send them
 * over the mutually authenticated network connection established with the
 * MQTT broker. This example is single threaded and uses statically allocated
 * memory. It uses QoS1 for sending to and receiving messages from the broker.
 *
 * A mutually authenticated TLS connection is used to connect to the
 * MQTT message broker in this example. Define democonfigMQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT,
 * democonfigROOT_CA_PEM, democonfigCLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PEM,
 * and democonfigCLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM in demo_config.h to establish a
 * mutually authenticated connection.
 *
 * Also see https://www.freertos.org/mqtt/mqtt-agent-demo.html? for an
 * alternative run time model whereby coreMQTT runs in an autonomous
 * background agent task.  Executing the MQTT protocol in an agent task
 * removes the need for the application writer to explicitly manage any MQTT
 * state or call the MQTT_ProcessLoop() API function. Using an agent task
 * also enables multiple application tasks to more easily share a single
 * MQTT connection.
