/* ****************************************************************************
 * This project includes a lot of tasks and tests and is therefore complex.
 * If you would prefer a much simpler project to get started with then select
 * the 'Blinky' build configuration within the HEW IDE.  The Blinky build
 * configuration uses main-blinky.c instead of main-full.c.
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The web
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks,
 * which provide no particular functionality but do provide a good example of
 * how to use the FreeRTOS API.  The tasks defined in flop.c are included in the
 * set of standard demo tasks to ensure the floating point unit gets some
 * exercise.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill the registers with known values, then 
 * repeatedly check that each register still contains its expected value for 
 * the lifetime of the tasks.  Each task uses different values.  The tasks run 
 * with very low priority so get preempted very frequently.  A check variable 
 * is incremented on each iteration of the test loop.  A register containing an 
 * unexpected value is indicative of an error in the context switching 
 * mechanism and will result in a branch to a null loop - which in turn will 
 * prevent the check variable from incrementing any further and allow the check 
 * timer (described below) to determine that an error has occurred.  The nature 
 * of the reg test tasks necessitates that they are written in assembly code.
 *
 * "Check Timer" and Callback Function - The check timer period is initially 
 * set to five seconds.  The check timer callback function checks that all the 
 * standard demo tasks are not only still executing, but are executing without 
 * reporting any errors.  If the check timer discovers that a task has either 
 * stalled, or reported an error, then it changes its own period from the 
 * initial five seconds, to just 200ms.  The check timer callback function 
 * also toggles LED 3 each time it is called.  This provides a visual 
 * indication of the system status:  If the LED toggles every five seconds, 
 * then no issues have been discovered.  If the LED toggles every 200ms, then 
 * an issue has been discovered with at least one task.
 *
 * "High frequency timer test" - A high frequency periodic interrupt is
 * generated using a timer - the interrupt is assigned a priority above
 * configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY, so will not be effected by anything
 * the kernel is doing.  The frequency and priority of the interrupt, in
 * combination with other standard tests executed in this demo, will result
 * in interrupts nesting at least 3 and probably 4 deep.  This test is only
 * included in build configurations that have the optimiser switched on.
 *
 * *NOTE 1* If LED3 is toggling every 5 seconds then all the demo application
 * tasks are executing as expected and no errors have been reported in any
 * tasks.  The toggle rate increasing to 200ms indicates that at least one task
 * has reported unexpected behaviour.
 *
 * *NOTE 2* vApplicationSetupTimerInterrupt() is called by the kernel to let
 * the application set up a timer to generate the tick interrupt.  In this
 * example a compare match timer is used for this purpose.
 *
 * *NOTE 3* The CPU must be in Supervisor mode when the scheduler is started.
 * The PowerON_Reset_PC() supplied in resetprg.c with this demo has
 * Change_PSW_PM_to_UserMode() commented out to ensure this is the case.
 *
 * *NOTE 4* The IntQueue common demo tasks test interrupt nesting and make use
 * of all the 8bit timers (as two cascaded 16bit units).
