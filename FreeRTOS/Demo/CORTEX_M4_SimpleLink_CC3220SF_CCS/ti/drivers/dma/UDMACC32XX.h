 *  @brief      uDMA driver implementation for CC32XX.
 *
 *  This driver is intended for use only by TI-RTOS drivers that use the uDMA
 *  peripheral (e.g., SPI and I2S).  This driver is mainly used for Power
 *  management of the UDMA peripheral.
 *
 *  The application should only define the memory for the control table and
 *  set up the UDMACC32XX_HWAttrs and UDMACC32XX_Config structures.
 *
 *  The UDMACC32XX header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/dma/UDMACC32XX.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ============================================================================

 *  @brief      UDMACC32XX Hardware attributes
 *
 *  This structure contains the base address of the uDMA control
 *  table, and uDMA error interrupt attributes.
 *
 *  The control table is used by the uDMA controller to store channel
 *  control structures.  The control table can be located anywhere in
 *  system memory, but must be contiguous and aligned on a 1024-byte boundary.
 *
 *  dmaErrorFxn is the uDMA peripheral's error interrupt handler.
 *
 *  intPriority is priority of the uDMA peripheral's error interrupt, as
 *  defined by the underlying OS.  It is passed unmodified to the
 *  underlying OS's interrupt handler creation code, so you need to
 *  refer to the OS documentation for usage.  For example, for
 *  SYS/BIOS applications, refer to the ti.sysbios.family.arm.m3.Hwi
 *  documentation for SYS/BIOS usage of interrupt priorities.  If the
 *  driver uses the ti.dpl interface instead of making OS
 *  calls directly, then the HwiP port handles the interrupt priority
 *  in an OS specific way.  In the case of the SYS/BIOS port,
 *  intPriority is passed unmodified to Hwi_create().
 *
 *  A sample structure is shown below:
 *  @code
 *
 *  #include <ti/devices/cc32xx/driverlib/udma.h>
 *
 *  #if defined(__TI_COMPILER_VERSION__)
 *  #pragma DATA_ALIGN(dmaControlTable, 1024)
 *  #elif defined(__IAR_SYSTEMS_ICC__)
 *  #pragma data_alignment=1024
 *  #elif defined(__GNUC__)
 *  __attribute__ ((aligned (1024)))
