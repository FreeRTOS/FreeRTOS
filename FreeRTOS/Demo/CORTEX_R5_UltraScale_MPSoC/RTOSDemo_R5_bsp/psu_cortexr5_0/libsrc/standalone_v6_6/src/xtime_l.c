/**

 *
 * This file contains low level functions to get/set time from the Global Timer
 * register in the ARM Cortex R5 core.
 *
 * <pre>
 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who    Date     Changes
 * ----- ------ -------- ---------------------------------------------------
 * 5.00     pkp    08/29/14 First release
 * 5.04  pkp	   02/19/16 XTime_StartTimer API is added to configure TTC3 timer
 *						when present. XTime_GetTime is modified to give 64bit
 *						output using timer overflow when TTC3 present.
 *						XTime_SetTime is modified to configure TTC3 counter
 *						value when present.
 * 5.04	pkp	   03/11/16 XTime_StartTimer is modified to avoid enabling the
 *						overflow interrupt and XTime_GetTime & XTime_SetTime
 *						are modified to read and write TTC counter value
 *						respectively
 * 5.04	pkp
 * 6.0   mus    08/11/16  Removed implementation of XTime_SetTime API, since
 *                        TTC counter value register is read only.
 * 6.6   srm    10/18/17 Removed XTime_StartTimer API and made XTime_GetTime,
 *                       XTime_SetTime applicable for all the instances of TTC
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * @note		None.
