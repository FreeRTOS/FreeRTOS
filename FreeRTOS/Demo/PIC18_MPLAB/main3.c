/*
 * THIS DEMO APPLICATION REQUIRES A LOOPBACK CONNECTOR TO BE FITTED TO THE PIC
 * USART PORT - connect pin 2 to pin 3 on J2.
 *
 * Instead of the normal single demo application, the PIC18F demo is split
 * into several smaller programs of which this is the third.  This enables the
 * demo's to be executed on the RAM limited 40 pin devices.  The 64 and 80 pin
 * devices require a more costly development platform and are not so readily
 * available.
 *
 * The RTOSDemo3 project is configured for a PIC18F452 device.  Main3.c starts
 * 5 tasks (including the idle task).
 *
 * The first task repeatedly transmits a string of characters on the PIC USART
 * port.  The second task receives the characters, checking that the correct
 * sequence is maintained (i.e. what is transmitted is identical to that
 * received).  Each transmitted and each received character causes an LED to
 * flash.  See demo/common/minimal/comtest. c for more information.
 *
 * The third task continuously performs a 32 bit calculation.  This is a good
 * test of the context switch mechanism as the 8 bit architecture requires
 * the use of several file registers to perform the 32 bit operations.  See
 * demo/common/minimal/integer. c for more information.
 *
 * The third task is the check task.  This periodically checks that the other
 * tasks are still running and have not experienced any errors.  If no errors
 * have been reported by either the comms or integer tasks an LED is flashed
 * with a frequency mainNO_ERROR_CHECK_PERIOD.  If an error is discovered the
 * frequency is increased to mainERROR_FLASH_RATE.
 *
 * The check task also provides a visual indication of a system reset by
 * flashing the one remaining LED (mainRESET_LED) when it starts.  After
 * this initial flash mainRESET_LED should remain off.
 *
 * http://www.FreeRTOS.org contains important information on the use of the
 * PIC18F port.
