 *
 *  @brief      FATFS driver interface
 *
 *  The SDFatFS header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/SDFatFS.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/SD.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *
 *  The SDFatFS driver is designed to hook into FatFs by implementing a
 *  set of functions that FatFs needs to call to perform basic block data
 *  transfers. This driver makes use of the SD driver for lower level disk IO
 *  operations.
 *
 *  The only functions that should be called by the application are the
 *  standard driver framework functions (_open, _close, etc...).
 *
 *  The application may use the FatFs APIs or the standard C
 *  runtime file I/O calls (fopen, fclose, etc...) given that SDFatFS_open has
 *  has been successfully called. After the SDFatFS_close API is called,
 *  ensure the application does NOT make any file I/O calls.
 *
 *  ## Opening the driver #
 *
 *  @code
 *  SDFatFS_Handle handle;
 *
 *  handle = SDFatFS_open(index, driveNum, NULL);
 *  if (!handle) {
 *      System_printf("Error opening SDFatFS driver\n");
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  The SDFatFS driver interface module is joined (at link time) to a NULL
 *  terminated array of SDFatFS_Config data structures named *SDFatFS_config*.
 *  *SDFatFS_config* is implemented in the application with each entry being an
 *  instance of the driver. Each entry in *SDFatFS_config* contains a:
 *  - (void *) data object that contains internal driver data structures
 *
 *  # Instrumentation #
 *
 *  The SDFatFS driver interface produces log statements if
 *  instrumentation is enabled.
 *
 *  Diagnostics Mask | Log details                   |
 *  ---------------- | -----------                   |
 *  Diags_USER1      | basic operations performed    |
 *  Diags_USER2      | detailed operations performed |
