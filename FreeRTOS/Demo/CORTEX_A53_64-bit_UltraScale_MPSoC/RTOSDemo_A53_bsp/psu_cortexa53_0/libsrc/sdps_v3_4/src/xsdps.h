 *
 * This file contains the implementation of XSdPs driver.
 * This driver is used initialize read from and write to the SD card.
 * Features such as switching bus width to 4-bit and switching to high speed,
 * changing clock frequency, block size etc. are supported.
 * SD 2.0 uses 1/4 bus width and speeds of 25/50KHz. Initialization, however
 * is done using 1-bit bus width and 400KHz clock frequency.
 * SD commands are classified as broadcast and addressed. Commands can be
 * those with response only (using only command line) or
 * response + data (using command and data lines).
 * Only one command can be sent at a time. During a data transfer however,
 * when dsta lines are in use, certain commands (which use only the command
 * line) can be sent, most often to obtain status.
 * This driver does not support multi card slots at present.
 *
 * Intialization:
 * This includes initialization on the host controller side to select
 * clock frequency, bus power and default transfer related parameters.
 * The default voltage is 3.3V.
 * On the SD card side, the initialization and identification state diagram is
 * implemented. This resets the card, gives it a unique address/ID and
 * identifies key card related specifications.
 *
 * Data transfer:
 * The SD card is put in tranfer state to read from or write to it.
 * The default block size is 512 bytes and if supported,
 * default bus width is 4-bit and bus speed is High speed.
 * The read and write functions are implemented in polled mode using ADMA2.
 *
 * At any point, when key parameters such as block size or
 * clock/speed or bus width are modified, this driver takes care of
 * maintaining the same selection on host and card.
 * All error bits in host controller are monitored by the driver and in the
 * event one of them is set, driver will clear the interrupt status and
 * communicate failure to the upper layer.
 *
 * File system use:
 * This driver can be used with xilffs library to read and write files to SD.
 * (Please refer to procedure in diskio.c). The file system read/write example
 * in polled mode can used for reference.
 *
 * There is no example for using SD driver without file system at present.
 * However, the driver can be used without the file system. The glue layer
 * in filesytem can be used as reference for the same. The block count
 * passed to the read/write function in one call is limited by the ADMA2
 * descriptor table and hence care will have to be taken to call read/write
 * API's in a loop for large file sizes.
 *
 * Interrupt mode is not supported because it offers no improvement when used
 * with file system.
 *
 * eMMC support:
 * SD driver supports SD and eMMC based on the "enable MMC" parameter in SDK.
 * The features of eMMC supported by the driver will depend on those supported
 * by the host controller. The current driver supports read/write on eMMC card
 * using 4-bit and high speed mode currently.
 *
 * Features not supported include - card write protect, password setting,
 * lock/unlock, interrupts, SDMA mode, programmed I/O mode and
 * 64-bit addressed ADMA2, erase/pre-erase commands.
