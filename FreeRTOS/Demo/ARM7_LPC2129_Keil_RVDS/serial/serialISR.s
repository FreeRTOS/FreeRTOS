	;The UART interrupt entry point is defined within an assembly wrapper
	;within this file.  This takes care of the task context saving before it
	;calls the main handler (vUART_ISRHandler()) which is written in C within
	;serial.c.  The execution of the handler can unblock tasks that were blocked
	;waiting for UART events.  Once the handler completes the asm wrapper
	;finishes off by	restoring the context of whichever task is now selected to
	;enter the RUNNING state (which might now be a different task to that which
