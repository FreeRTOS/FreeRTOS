/** ============================================================================
 *  @file       ADCBuf.h
 *
 *  @brief      ADCBuf driver interface
 *
 *  The ADCBuf header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/ADCBuf.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *  The ADCBuf driver in TI-RTOS samples an analogue waveform at a specified
 *  frequency. The resulting samples are transferred to a buffer provided by
 *  the application. The driver can either take n samples once, or continuously
 *  sample by double-buffering and providing a callback to process each finished
 *  buffer.
 *
 *  The APIs in this driver serve as an interface to a typical TI-RTOS
 *  application. The specific peripheral implementations are responsible to
 *  create all the SYS/BIOS specific primitives to allow for thread-safe
 *  operation.
 *
 *  User can use the ADC driver or the ADCBuf driver. But both ADC and ADCBuf
 *  cannot be used together in an application.
 *
 *  ## Opening the driver #
 *
 *  @code
 *      ADCBuf_Handle adcBufHandle;
 *      ADCBuf_Params adcBufParams;
 *
 *      ADCBuf_Params_init(&adcBufParams);
 *      adcBufHandle = ADCBuf_open(Board_ADCBuf0, &adcBufParams);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## Making a conversion #
 *  In this context, a conversion refers to taking multiple ADC samples and
 *  transferring them to an application-provided buffer.
 *  To start a conversion, the application must configure an ADCBuf_Conversion struct
 *  and call ADCBuf_convert(). In blocking mode, ADCBuf_convert() will return
 *  when the conversion is finished and the desired number of samples have been made.
 *  In callback mode, ADCBuf_convert() will return immediately and the application will
 *  get a callback when the conversion is done.
 *
 *  @code
 *      ADCBuf_Conversion blockingConversion;
 *
 *      blockingConversion.arg = NULL;
 *      blockingConversion.adcChannel = Board_ADCCHANNEL_A1;
 *      blockingConversion.sampleBuffer = sampleBufferOnePtr;
 *      blockingConversion.sampleBufferTwo = NULL;
 *      blockingConversion.samplesRequestedCount = ADCBUFFERSIZE;
 *
 *      if (!ADCBuf_convert(adcBuf, &continuousConversion, 1)) {
 *          // handle error
 *      }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## Canceling a conversion #
 *  ADCBuf_convertCancel() is used to cancel an ADCBuf conversion when the driver is
 *  used in ::ADCBuf_RETURN_MODE_CALLBACK.
 *
 *  Calling this API while no conversion is in progress has no effect. If a
 *  conversion is in progress, it is canceled and the provided callback function
 *  is called.
 *
 *  In ::ADCBuf_RECURRENCE_MODE_CONTINUOUS, this function must be called to stop the
 *  conversion. The driver will continue providing callbacks with fresh samples
 *  until thie ADCBuf_convertCancel() function is called. The callback function is not
 *  called after ADCBuf_convertCancel() while in ::ADCBuf_RECURRENCE_MODE_CONTINUOUS.
 *
 *  # Implementation #
 *
 *  This module serves as the main interface for TI-RTOS applications. Its
 *  purpose is to redirect the module's APIs to specific peripheral
 *  implementations which are specified using a pointer to an ADCBuf_FxnTable.
 *
 *  The ADCBuf driver interface module is joined (at link time) to a
 *  NULL-terminated array of ADCBuf_Config data structures named *ADCBuf_config*.
 *  *ADCBuf_config* is implemented in the application with each entry being an
 *  instance of an ADCBuf peripheral. Each entry in *ADCBuf_config* contains a:
 *  - (ADCBuf_FxnTable *) to a set of functions that implement an ADCBuf peripheral
 *  - (void *) data object that is associated with the ADCBuf_FxnTable
 *  - (void *) hardware attributes that are associated to the ADCBuf_FxnTable
 *
 *  # Instrumentation #
 *
 *  The ADCBuf driver interface produces log statements if instrumentation is
 *  enabled.
 *
 *  Diagnostics Mask | Log details                      |
