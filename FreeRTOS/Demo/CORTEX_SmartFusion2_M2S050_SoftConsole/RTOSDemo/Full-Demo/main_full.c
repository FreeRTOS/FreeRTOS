/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * configCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in FreeRTOSConifg.h is used to
 * select between the two.  See the notes on using
 * configCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY in main.c.  This file implements the
 * comprehensive test and demo version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * full demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware, are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_full() creates all the demo application tasks and a software timer, then
 * starts the scheduler.  The web documentation provides more details of the
 * standard demo application tasks, which provide no particular functionality,
 * but do provide a good example of how to use the FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Check" timer - The check software timer period is initially set to three
 * seconds.  The callback function associated with the check software timer
 * checks that all the standard demo tasks are not only still executing, but
 * are executing without reporting any errors.  If the check software timer
 * discovers that a task has either stalled, or reported an error, then it
 * changes its own execution period from the initial three seconds, to just
 * 200ms.  The check software timer callback function also toggles the green
 * LED each time it is called.  This provides a visual indication of the system
 * status:  If the green LED toggles every three seconds, then no issues have
 * been discovered.  If the green LED toggles every 200ms, then an issue has
 * been discovered with at least one task.
 *
 * FreeRTOS+CLI command console.  The command console is access through UART0
 * using 115200 baud and the Microsemi MSS UART drivers.  Type "help" to see a
 * list of registered commands, which include some basic file system commands
 * (see FreeRTOS+FAT SL comments below). The FreeRTOS+CLI license is different
 * to the FreeRTOS license, see http://www.FreeRTOS.org/cli for license and
 * usage details.
 *
 * FreeRTOS+FAT SL.  FreeRTOS+FAT SL is demonstrated using a RAM disk.  [At the
 * time of writing] The functionality of the file system demo is identical to
 * the functionality of the FreeRTOS Win32 simulator file system demo with the
 * command console being accessed via the UART (as described above) instead of
 * a network terminal.  The FreeRTOS+FAT SL license is different to the FreeRTOS
 * license, see http://www.FreeRTOS.org/fat_sl for license and usage details,
 * and a description of the file system demo functionality.
 *
 * See the documentation page for this demo on the FreeRTOS.org web site for
 * full information, including hardware setup requirements.
