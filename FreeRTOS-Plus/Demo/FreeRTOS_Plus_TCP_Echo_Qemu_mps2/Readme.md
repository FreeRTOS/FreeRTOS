# TCP Echo Client Demo for MPS2 Cortex-M3 AN385 emulated using QEMU
This FreeRTOS+TCP example demonstrates a TCP Echo Client which sends
echo requests to an Echo Server and then receives the echo reply. The
Echo Client runs on the MPS2 Cortex-M3 AN385 platform emulated using QEMU.

The demo is being run using the following configurations:
1. [ User Networking (SLIRP) ](Readme_UserNetworking.md)
