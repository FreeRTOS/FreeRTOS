/*
 * main-blinky.c is included when the "Blinky" build configuration is used.
 * main-full.c is included when the "Full" build configuration is used.
 *
 * main-full.c (this file) defines a comprehensive demo that creates many
 * tasks, queues, semaphores and timers.  It also demonstrates how Cortex-M3
 * interrupts can interact with FreeRTOS tasks/timers.
 *
 * This project runs on the SK-FM3-100PMC evaluation board, which is populated
 * with an MB9BF5006N Cortex-M3 based microcontroller.
 *
 * The main() Function:
 * main() creates three demo specific software timers, one demo specific queue,
 * and two demo specific tasks.  It then creates a whole host of 'standard
 * demo' tasks/queues/semaphores, before starting the scheduler.  The demo
 * specific tasks and timers are described in the comments here.  The standard
 * demo tasks are described on the FreeRTOS.org web site.
 *
 * The standard demo tasks provide no specific functionality.  They are
 * included to both test the FreeRTOS port, and provide examples of how the
 * various FreeRTOS API functions can be used.
 *
 * This demo creates 43 tasks in total.  If you want a simpler demo, use the
 * Blinky build configuration.
 *
 * The Demo Specific Queue Send Task:
 * The queue send task is implemented by the prvQueueSendTask() function in
 * this file.  prvQueueSendTask() sits in a loop that causes it to repeatedly
 * block for 200 milliseconds, before sending the value 100 to the queue that
 * was created within main().  Once the value is sent, the task loops back
 * around to block for another 200 milliseconds.
 *
 * The Demo Specific Queue Receive Task:
 * The queue receive task is implemented by the prvQueueReceiveTask() function
 * in this file.  prvQueueReceiveTask() sits in a loop that causes it to
 * repeatedly attempt to read data from the queue that was created within
 * main().  When data is received, the task checks the value of the data, and
 * if the value equals the expected 100, toggles an LED in the 7 segment display
 * (see the documentation page for this demo on the FreeRTOS.org site to see
 * which LED is used).  The 'block time' parameter passed to the queue receive
 * function specifies that the task should be held in the Blocked state
 * indefinitely to wait for data to be available on the queue.  The queue
 * receive task will only leave the Blocked state when the queue send task
 * writes to the queue.  As the queue send task writes to the queue every 200
 * milliseconds, the queue receive task leaves the Blocked state every 200
 * milliseconds, and therefore toggles the LED every 200 milliseconds.
 *
 * The Demo Specific LED Software Timer and the Button Interrupt:
 * The user button SW2 is configured to generate an interrupt each time it is
 * pressed.  The interrupt service routine switches an LED on, and resets the
 * LED software timer.  The LED timer has a 5000 millisecond (5 second) period,
 * and uses a callback function that is defined to just turn the LED off again.
 * Therefore, pressing the user button will turn the LED on, and the LED will
 * remain on until a full five seconds pass without the button being pressed.
 * See the documentation page for this demo on the FreeRTOS.org web site to see
 * which LED is used.
 *
 * The Demo Specific "Check" Callback Function:
 * This is called each time the 'check' timer expires.  The check timer
 * callback function inspects all the standard demo tasks to see if they are
 * all executing as expected.  The check timer is initially configured to
 * expire every three seconds, but will shorted this to every 500ms if an error
 * is ever discovered.  The check timer callback toggles the LED defined by
 * the mainCHECK_LED definition each time it executes.  Therefore, if LED
 * mainCHECK_LED is toggling every three seconds, then no error have been found.
 * If LED mainCHECK_LED is toggling every 500ms, then at least one errors has
 * been found.  The variable pcStatusMessage is set to a string that indicates
 * which task reported an error.  See the documentation page for this demo on
 * the FreeRTOS.org web site to see which LED in the 7 segment display is used.
 *
 * The Demo Specific "Digit Counter" Callback Function:
 * This is called each time the 'digit counter' timer expires.  It causes the
 * digits 0 to 9 to be displayed in turn as the first character of the two
 * character display.  The LEDs in the other digit of the two character
 * display are used as general purpose LEDs, as described in this comment block.
 *
 * The Demo Specific Idle Hook Function:
 * The idle hook function demonstrates how to query the amount of FreeRTOS heap
 * space that is remaining (see vApplicationIdleHook() defined in this file).
 *
 * The Demo Specific Tick Hook Function:
 * The tick hook function is used to test the interrupt safe software timer
 * functionality.
