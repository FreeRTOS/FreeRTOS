/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the simply blinky version.
 *
 * This file only contains the source code that is specific to the basic demo.
 * Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_blinky() creates one queue, one software timer, and two tasks.  It then
 * starts the scheduler.
 *
 * The Queue Send Task:
 * The queue send task is implemented by the prvQueueSendTask() function in
 * this file.  It uses vTaskDelayUntil() to create a periodic task that sends
 * the value 100 to the queue every 200 (simulated) milliseconds.
 *
 * The Queue Send Software Timer:
 * The timer is an auto-reload timer with a period of two (simulated) seconds.
 * Its callback function writes the value 200 to the queue.  The callback
 * function is implemented by prvQueueSendTimerCallback() within this file.
 *
 * The Queue Receive Task:
 * The queue receive task is implemented by the prvQueueReceiveTask() function
 * in this file.  prvQueueReceiveTask() waits for data to arrive on the queue.
 * When data is received, the task checks the value of the data, then outputs a
 * message to indicate if the data came from the queue send task or the queue
 * send software timer.
