/* BASIC INTERRUPT DRIVEN SERIAL PORT DRIVER.

 * This is not a proper UART driver.  It only supports one port, and is not
 * intended to show an efficient implementation as queues are used to pass
 * individual characters one at a time!  This is ok for a slow interface, such
 * as a command line interface (which this driver is used for), but is too
 * inefficient for higher bandwidth applications.
