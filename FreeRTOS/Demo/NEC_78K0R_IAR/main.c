/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks.
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Check" task -  This only executes every three seconds but has a high priority
 * to ensure it gets processor time.  Its main function is to check that all the
 * standard demo tasks are still operational.  If everything is running as
 * expected then the check task will toggle an LED every 3 seconds.  An error
 * being discovered in any task will cause the toggle rate to increase to 500ms.
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill the registers with known values, then check
 * that each register still contains its expected value.  Each task uses
 * different values.  The tasks run with very low priority so get preempted very
 * frequently.  A register containing an unexpected value is indicative of an
 * error in the context switching mechanism.
 *
 *
 * Also in addition to the standard demo tasks is a button push task.  This is
 * a very basic task that is included as an example of how to write an interrupt
 * service routine that interacts with a task.  The button on the target board
 * is used to generate an interrupt that 'gives' a semaphore in order to unblock
 * a task.  In doing so the task is synchronised with the interrupt.  Each time
 * the task unblocks it simply toggles an LED before entering the Blocked state
 * again to wait for the next button push.
