  @mainpage CoreI2C Bare Metal Driver.
   The CoreI2C bare metal software driver supports I2C master and slave
   operations.

  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The CoreI2C driver provides a set of functions for controlling the Microsemi
  CoreI2C hardware IP. The driver supports up to 16 separate I2C channels per
  CoreI2C instance, with common slave address settings shared between channels
  on a device.
  
  Optional features of the CoreI2C allow it operate with I2C based protocols
  such as System Management Bus (SMBus), Power Management Bus (PMBus) and
  Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI). This driver provides support
  for these features when enabled in the CoreI2C IP.
  
  The major features provided by CoreI2C driver are:
    - Support for configuring the I2C channels of each CoreI2C peripheral.
    - I2C master operations.
    - I2C slave operations.
    - SMBus related operations.

  This driver can be used as part of a bare metal system where no operating 
  system  is available. The driver can be adapted for use as part of an 
  operating system, but the implementation of the adaptation layer between the 
  driver and  the operating system's driver model is outside the scope of this 
  driver.
  
  @section hw_dependencies Hardware Flow Dependencies
  Your application software should configure the CoreI2C driver through
  calls to the I2C_init() function for each CoreI2C instance in the
  hardware design.  The configuration parameters include the CoreI2C hardware
  instance base address and other runtime parameters, such as the I2C serial
  clock frequency and I2C device address.
  
  Once channel 0 of a CoreI2C peripheral has been initialized via I2C_init(),
  any additional channels present should be configured by calling
  I2C_channel_init() for each of the remaining channels.
  
  No CoreI2C hardware configuration parameters are used by the driver, apart
  from the CoreI2C hardware instance base address. Hence, no additional
  configuration files are required to use the driver. 
  
  Interrupt Control
  The CoreI2C driver has to enable and disable the generation of interrupts by
  CoreI2C at various times when it is operating. This enabling and disabling of
  interrupts must be done through the system’s interrupt controller. For that
  reason, the method of controlling the CoreI2C interrupt is system specific
  and it is necessary to customize the I2C_enable_irq() and I2C_disable_irq()
  functions. These functions are found in the file i2c_interrupt.c. Their
  default implementation fires an assertion to attract attention to the fact
  that these functions must be modified.
  
  The implementation of the I2C_enable_irq() function should permit interrupts
  generated by a CoreI2C instance to interrupt the processor. The implementation
  of the I2C_disable_irq() function should prevent interrupts generated by a
  CoreI2C instance from interrupting the processor. Please refer to the provided
  example projects for a working implementation of these functions.
  
  The function I2C_register_write_handler() is used to register a write handler
  function with the CoreI2C driver that it calls on completion of an I2C write
  transaction by the CoreI2C slave. It is your responsibility to create and
  register the implementation of this handler function that processes or
  trigger the processing of the received data.
  
  The SMBSUS and SMBALERT interrupts are related to the SMBus interface and are
  enabled and disabled through I2C_enable_smbus_irq() and 
  I2C_disable_smbus_irq() respectively. It is your responsibility to create
  interrupt handler functions in your application to get the desired response
  for the SMBus interrupts.

  Note: You must include the path to any application header files that are
        included in the i2c_interrupt.c file, as an include path in your
        project’s compiler settings. The details of how to do this will depend
        on your development software.

  SMBus Logic options
  SMBus related APIs will not have any effect if in CoreI2C hardware
  configuration "Generate SMBus Logic" is not enabled. The APIs which will not
  give desired results in case SMBus Logic is disabled are:
  
      I2C_smbus_init()
      I2C_reset_smbus()
      I2C_enable_smbus_irq()
      I2C_disable_smbus_irq()
      I2C_suspend_smbus_slave()
      I2C_resume_smbus_slave()
      I2C_set_smsbus_alert()
      I2C_clear_smsbus_alert()
      I2C_get_irq_status() 

  Fixed Baud Rate Values
  The serial clock frequency parameter passed to the I2C_init() and 
  I2C_channel_init() functions may not have any effect if fixed values were
  selected for Baud rate in the hardware configuration of CoreI2C. When fixed
  values are selected for these baud rates, the driver cannot overwrite
  the fixed values.

  Fixed Slave Address Options Values
  The primary slave address  parameter passed to the I2C_init() function, and
  secondary address value passed to the I2C_set_slave_second_addr() function,
  may not have the desired effect if fixed values were selected for the slave 0
  address and slave 1 address respectively. Proper operation of this version of
  the driver requires the slave addresses to be programmable.

  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The CoreI2C software driver is designed to allow the control of multiple
  instances of CoreI2C with one or more I2C channels. Each channel in an
  instance of CoreI2C in the hardware design is associated with a single 
  instance of the i2c_instance_t structure in the software. You must allocate
  memory for one unique i2c_instance_t structure instance for each channel of
  each CoreI2C hardware instance. The contents of these data structures are
  initialised during calls to I2C_init() and if necessary I2C_channel_init().
  A pointer to the structure is passed to subsequent driver functions in order
  to identify the CoreI2C hardware instance and channel you wish to perform the
  requested operation.

  Note: Do not attempt to directly manipulate the contents of i2c_instance_t
       structures. These structures are only intended to be modified by the driver
       functions.

  The CoreI2C driver functions are grouped into the following categories:
    - Initialization and configuration functions
    - Interrupt control
    - I2C slave addressing functions
    - I2C master operations functions to handle write, read and write-read 
      transactions
    - I2C slave operations functions to handle write, read and write-read 
      transactions
    - Mixed master-slave operations 
    - SMBus interface configuration and control.
    
  Initialization and Configuration
    The CoreI2C device is first initialized through a call to the I2C_init()
    function. Since each CoreI2C peripheral supports up to 16 channels, an
    additional function, I2C_channel_init(), is required to initialize the
    remaining channels with their own data structures.

    I2C_init() initializes channel 0 of a CoreI2C and the i2c_instance_t for
    channel 0 acts as the basis for further channel initialization as the
    hardware base address and I2C serial address are same across all the
    channels. I2C_init() must be called before any other  I2C driver function
    calls. The I2C_init() call for each CoreI2C takes the I2C serial address
    assigned to the I2C and the serial clock divider to be used to generate its
    I2C clock as configuration parameters. 
    
    I2C_channel_init() takes as input parameters a pointer to the CoreI2C 
    i2c_instance_t which has been initialized via I2C_init() and a pointer to a
    separate i2c_instance_t which represents this new channel. Another input
    parameter which is required by this function is serial clock divider which
    generates its I2C clock. 
    
  Interrupt Control
    The CoreI2C driver is interrupt driven and it uses each channels INT
    interrupt to drive the state machine which is at the heart of the driver.
    The application is responsible for providing the link between the interrupt
    generating hardware and the CoreI2C interrupt handler and must ensure that
    the I2C_isr() function is called with the correct i2c_instance_t structure
    pointer for the CoreI2C channel initiating the interrupt.
    
    The driver enables and disables the generation of INT interrupts by CoreI2C
    at various times when it is operating through the user supplied
    I2C_enable_irq() and I2C_disable_irq() functions. 
    
    The function I2C_register_write_handler() is used to register a write
    handler function with the CoreI2C driver which is called on completion
    of an I2C write transaction by the CoreI2C slave. It is the user
    applications responsibility to create and register the implementation of
    this handler function that processes or triggers the processing of the
    received data. 
    
    The other two interrupt sources in the CoreI2C, are related to SMBus
    operation and are enabled and disabled through I2C_enable_smbus_irq() and
    I2C_disable_smbus_irq() respectively. Due to the application specific
    nature of the response to SMBus interrupts, you must design interrupt
    handler functions in the application to get the desired behaviour for
    SMBus related interrupts.
    
    If enabled, the SMBA_INT signal from the CoreI2C is asserted if an
    SMBALERT condition is signalled on the SMBALERT_NI input for the channel.
    
    If enabled, the SMBS_INT signal from the CoreI2C is asserted if an
    SMBSUSPEND condition is signalled on the SMBSUS_NI input for the channel.

  I2C slave addressing functions
    A CoreI2C peripheral can respond to three slave addresses:
    - Slave address 0 - This is the primary slave address which is used for
                        accessing a CoreI2C channel when it acts as a slave in
                        I2C transactions. You must configure the primary slave
                        address via I2C_init().
                        
    - Slave address 1 - This is the secondary slave address which might be
                        required in certain application specific scenarios.
                        The secondary slave address can be configured via
                        I2C_set_slave_second_addr() and disabled via 
                        I2C_disable_slave_second_addr().
                        
    - General call address - A CoreI2C slave can be configured to respond to
                        a broadcast command by a master transmitting the
                        general call address of 0x00. Use the I2C_set_gca()
                        function to enable the slave to respond to the general
                        call address. If the CoreI2C slave is not required to
                        respond to the general call address, disable this
                        address by calling I2C_clear_gca().

    Note: All channels on a CoreI2C instance share the same slave address logic.
          This means that they cannot have separate slave addresses and rely on
          the separate physical I2C bus connections to distinguish them.
          
  Transaction Types
    The I2C driver is designed to handle three types of I2C transaction:
      Write transactions
      Read transactions
      Write-read transactions
 
    Write transaction
      The master I2C device initiates a write transaction by sending a START bit
      as soon as the bus becomes free. The START bit is followed by the 7-bit
      serial address of the target slave device followed by the read/write bit
      indicating the direction of the transaction. The slave acknowledges the
      receipt of it's address with an acknowledge bit. The master sends data one
      byte at a time to the slave, which must acknowledge receipt of each byte
      for the next byte to be sent. The master sends a STOP bit to complete the
      transaction. The slave can abort the transaction by replying with a 
      non-acknowledge bit instead of an acknowledge.
      
      The application programmer can choose not to send a STOP bit at the end of
      the transaction causing the next transaction to begin with a repeated 
      START bit.
      
    Read transaction
      The master I2C device initiates a read transaction by sending a START bit
      as soon as the bus becomes free. The START bit is followed by the 7-bit
      serial address of the target slave device followed by the read/write bit
      indicating the direction of the transaction. The slave acknowledges
      receipt of it's slave address with an acknowledge bit. The slave sends
      data one byte at a time to the master, which must acknowledge receipt of
      each byte for the next byte to be sent. The master sends a non-acknowledge
      bit following the last byte it wishes to read followed by a STOP bit.
      
      The application programmer can choose not to send a STOP bit at the end of
      the transaction causing the next transaction to begin with a repeated 
      START bit.
 
    Write-read transaction
      The write-read transaction is a combination of a write transaction
      immediately followed by a read transaction. There is no STOP bit between
      the write and read phases of a write-read transaction. A repeated START
      bit is sent between the write and read phases.
      
      Whilst the write handler is being executed, the slave holds the clock line
      low to stretch the clock until the response is ready.
      
      The write-read transaction is typically used to send a command or offset
      in the write transaction specifying the logical data to be transferred
      during the read phase.
      
      The application programmer can choose not to send a STOP bit at the end of
      the transaction causing the next transaction to begin with a repeated
      START bit.

  Master Operations
    The application can use the I2C_write(), I2C_read() and I2C_write_read()
    functions to initiate an I2C bus transaction. The application can then wait
    for the transaction to complete using the I2C_wait_complete() function
    or poll the status of the I2C transaction using the I2C_get_status()
    function until it returns a value different from I2C_IN_PROGRESS. The
    I2C_system_tick() function can be used to set a time base for the
    I2C_wait_complete() function’s time out delay.

  Slave Operations
    The configuration of the  I2C driver to operate as an I2C slave requires
    the use of the following functions:
       I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer()
       I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer()
       I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length()
       I2C_register_write_handler()
       I2C_enable_slave()
       
    Use of all functions is not required if the slave I2C does not need to support
    all types of I2C read transactions. The subsequent sections list the functions
    that must be used to support each transaction type. 
    
    Responding to read transactions
      The following functions are used to configure the  CoreI2C driver to
      respond to I2C read transactions:
        I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer()
        I2C_enable_slave()
        
      The function I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer() specifies the data buffer that
      will be transmitted when the I2C slave is the target of an I2C read
      transaction. It is then up to the application to manage the content of
      that buffer to control the data that will be transmitted to the I2C
      master as a result of the read transaction.
      
      The function I2C_enable_slave() enables the  I2C hardware instance
      to respond to I2C transactions. It must be called after the  I2C driver
      has been configured to respond to the required transaction types.

    Responding to write transactions
      The following functions are used to configure the  I2C driver to respond
      to I2C write transactions:
        I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer()
        I2C_register_write_handler()
        I2C_enable_slave()
        
      The function I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer() specifies the data buffer that
      will be used to store the data received by the I2C slave when it is the
      target an I2C  write transaction.
      
      The function I2C_register_write_handler() specifies the handler function
      that must be called on completion of the I2C write transaction. It is this
      handler function that processes or triggers the processing of the received
      data.
      
      The function I2C_enable_slave() enables the  I2C hardware instance
      to respond to I2C transactions. It must be called after the  I2C driver
      has been configured to respond to the required transaction types.

    Responding to write-read transactions
      The following functions are used to configure the CoreI2C driver to 
      respond to write-read transactions:
        I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length()
        I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer()
        I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer()
        I2C_register_write_handler()
        I2C_enable_slave()
        
      The function I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length() specifies the number of
      bytes expected by the I2C slave during the write phase of the write-read
      transaction.
      
      The function I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer() specifies the data that will be
      transmitted to the I2C master during the read phase of the write-read
      transaction. The value received by the I2C slave during the write phase of
      the transaction will be used as an index into the transmit buffer
      specified by this function to decide which part of the transmit buffer
      will be transmitted to the I2C master as part of the read phase of the
      write-read transaction. 
      
      The function I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer() specifies the data buffer that
      will be used to store the data received by the I2C slave during the write
      phase of the write-read transaction. This buffer must be at least large
      enough to accommodate the number of bytes specified through the
      I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length() function.
      
      The function I2C_register_write_handler() can optionally be used to
      specify a handler function that is called on completion of the write phase
      of the I2C write-read transaction. If a handler function is registered, it
      is responsible for processing the received data in the slave receive
      buffer and populating the slave transmit buffer with the data that will be
      transmitted to the I2C master as part of the read phase of the write-read
      transaction.
      
      The function I2C_enable_slave() enables the CoreI2C hardware instance to 
      respond to I2C transactions. It must be called after the CoreI2C driver
      has been configured to respond to the required transaction types.

  Mixed Master-Slave Operations
    The CoreI2C device supports mixed master and slave operations. If the 
    CoreI2C slave has a transaction in progress and your application attempts to
    begin a master mode transaction, the CoreI2C driver queu3es the master mode
    transaction until the bus is released and the CoreI2C can switch to master
    mode and acquire the bus. The CoreI2C master then starts the previously
    queued master transaction.
    
  SMBus Control
    The CoreI2C driver enables the CoreI2C peripheral’s SMBus functionality
    using the I2C_smbus_init() function.
    
    The I2C_suspend_smbus_slave() function is used, with a master mode CoreI2C,
    to force slave devices on the SMBus to enter their power-down/suspend mode.
    The I2C_resume_smbus_slave() function is used to end the suspend operation
    on the SMBus.
    
    The I2C_reset_smbus() function is used, with a master mode CoreI2C, to force
    all devices on the SMBus to reset their SMBUs interface.
    
    The I2C_set_smsbus_alert() function is used, by a slave mode CoreI2C, to
    force communication with the SMBus master. Once communications with the
    master is initiated, the I2C_clear_smsbus_alert() function is used to clear
    the alert condition.
    
    The I2C_enable_smbus_irq() and I2C_disable_smbus_irq() functions are used to
    enable and disable the SMBSUS and SMBALERT SMBus interrupts.

  Slave write handler functions prototype.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This defines the function prototype that must be followed by  I2C slave write
  handler functions. These functions are registered with the CoreI2C driver
  through the I2C_register_write_handler() function.

  Declaring and Implementing Slave Write Handler Functions:
    Slave write handler functions should follow the following prototype:
    i2c_slave_handler_ret_t write_handler
    ( 
        i2c_instance_t *instance, uint8_t * data, uint16_t size 
    );

    The instance parameter is a pointer to the i2c_instance_t for which this
    slave write handler has been declared.
    
    The data parameter is a pointer to a buffer (received data buffer) holding
    the data written to the I2C slave.
    
    Defining the macro INCLUDE_SLA_IN_RX_PAYLOAD causes the driver to insert the
    actual address used to access the slave as the first byte in the buffer.
    This allows applications tailor their response based on the actual address
    used to access the slave (primary address, secondary address or GCA).
    
    The size parameter is the number of bytes held in the received data buffer.
    Handler functions must return one of the following values:
        I2C_REENABLE_SLAVE_RX
        I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX.
        
    If the handler function returns I2C_REENABLE_SLAVE_RX, the driver releases
    the received data buffer and allows further I2C write transactions to the
    I2C slave to take place.
    
    If the handler function returns I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX, the I2C slave responds
    to subsequent write requests with a non-acknowledge bit (NACK), until the
    received data buffer content has been processed by some other part of the
    software application.
    
    A call to I2C_enable_slave() is required at some point after returning
    I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX in order to release the received data buffer so it can
    be used to store data received by subsequent I2C write transactions.

  This structure is used to identify the various CoreI2C hardware instances in

  I2C initialization routine.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The I2C_init() function is used to configure channel 0 of a CoreI2C instance.
  It sets the base hardware address which is used to locate the CoreI2C instance
  in memory and also used internally by I2C_channel_init() to calculate the
  register addresses for any additional channels. The slave serial address set
  is shared by all channels on a CoreI2C instance. 
  
  If only one channel is configured in a CoreI2C, the address of the 
  i2c_instance_t used in I2C_Init() will also be used in subsequent calls to the
  CoreI2C driver functions. If more than one channel is configured in the
  CoreI2C, I2C_channel_init() will be called after I2C_init(), which initializes
  the i2c_instance_t data structure for a specific channel.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @param this_i2c:
    Pointer to the i2c_instance_t data structure which will hold all data
    related to channel 0 of the CoreI2C instance being initialized. A pointer
    to this structure will be used in all subsequent calls to CoreI2C driver
    functions which are to operate on channel 0 of this CoreI2C instance.
  
  @param base_address:
    Base address in the processor's memory map of the registers of the CoreI2C
    instance being initialized.
 
  @param ser_address:
    This parameter sets the primary I2C serial address (SLAVE0 address) for the
    CoreI2C being initialized. It is the principal I2C bus address to which the
    CoreI2C instance will respond. CoreI2C can operate in master mode or slave
    mode and the serial address is significant only in the case of I2C slave
    mode. In master mode, CoreI2C does not require a serial address and the
    value of this parameter is not important. If you do not intend to use the
    CoreI2C device in slave mode, then any dummy slave address value can be
    provided to this parameter. However, in systems where the CoreI2C may be
    expected to switch from master mode to slave mode, it is advisable to
    initialize the CoreI2C device with a valid serial slave address.
    
    You need to call the I2C_init() function whenever it is required to change 
    the primary slave address as there is no separate function to set the
    primary slave address of the I2C device. The serial address being
    initialized through this function is basically the primary slave address or
    slave address0. I2C_set_slave_second_addr() can be used to set the
    secondary slave address or slave address 1.
    Note : ser_address parameter does not have any affect if fixed slave 
           address is enabled in CoreI2C hardware design. CoreI2C will 
           be always addressed with the hardware configured fixed slave
           address.
    Note : ser_address parameter will not have any affect if the CoreI2C
           instance is only used in master mode.

  @param ser_clock_speed:
    This parameter sets the I2C serial clock frequency. It selects the divider
    that will be used to generate the serial clock from the APB PCLK or from
    the BCLK. It can be one of the following:
        I2C_PCLK_DIV_256
        I2C_PCLK_DIV_224
        I2C_PCLK_DIV_192
        I2C_PCLK_DIV_160
        I2C_PCLK_DIV_960
        I2C_PCLK_DIV_120
        I2C_PCLK_DIV_60
        I2C_BCLK_DIV_8
    Note: serial_clock_speed value will have no affect if Fixed baud rate is 
          enabled in CoreI2C hardware instance configuration dialogue window. 
          The fixed baud rate divider value will override the value
          passed as parameter in this function.
    Note: serial_clock_speed value is not critical for devices that only operate
          as slaves and can be set to any of the above values.  

  @return none.  
  
  Example:
  @code
    #define COREI2C_BASE_ADDR  0xC0000000u

  The I2C_channel_init() function initializes and configures hardware and data

  will be used as an input parameter to subsequent CoreI2C driver functions
  which operate on this channel.

    Pointer to the i2c_instance_t data structure holding all data related to the
    CoreI2C channel being initialized. A pointer to the same data structure will

    identify the CoreI2C channel instance that should perform the operation 
    implemented by the called driver function.

  @param this_i2c:
    This is a pointer to an i2c_instance_t structure previously initialized by
    I2C_init(). It holds information regarding the hardware base address and
    I2C serial address for the CoreI2C containing the channel to be
    initialized. This information is required by I2C_channel_init() to
    initialize the i2c_instance_t structure pointed to by this_i2c_channel as
    all channels in a CoreI2C instance share the same base address and serial
    address. It is very important that the i2c_instance_t structure pointed to
    by this_i2c has been previously initialized with a call to I2C_init().
    
  @param channel_number:
    This parameter of type i2c_channel_number_t identifies the channel to be
    initialized.

  @param ser_clock_speed:
    This parameter sets the I2C serial clock frequency. It selects the divider
    that will be used to generate the serial clock from the APB PCLK or from
    the BCLK. It can be one of the following:
        I2C_PCLK_DIV_256
        I2C_PCLK_DIV_224

        I2C_PCLK_DIV_60
        I2C_BCLK_DIV_8
    
    Note: serial_clock_speed value will have no affect if Fixed baud rate is

  I2C master write-read
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This function initiates an I2C write-read transaction where data is first
  written to the target device before issuing a restart condition and changing
  the direction of the I2C transaction in order to read from the target device.
  
  The same warnings about buffer allocation in I2C_write() and I2C_read() 
  apply to this function.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  @param this_i2c:
    The this_i2c parameter is a pointer to the i2c_instance_t data structure
    holding all data related to a specific CoreI2C channel. For example, if only
    one channel is initialized, this data structure holds the information of
    channel 0 of the instantiated CoreI2C hardware.
  
  @param serial_addr:
    This parameter specifies the serial address of the target I2C device.
  
  @param addr_offset:
    This parameter is a pointer to the buffer containing the data that will be
    sent to the slave during the write phase of the write-read transaction. This
    data is typically used to specify an address offset specifying to the I2C
    slave device what data it must return during the read phase of the
    write-read transaction.
  
  @param offset_size:
    This parameter specifies the number of offset bytes to be written during the
    write phase of the write-read transaction. This is typically the size of the
    buffer pointed to by the addr_offset parameter.
  
  @param read_buffer:
    This parameter is a pointer to the buffer where the data read from the I2C
    slave will be stored.
  
  @param read_size:
    This parameter specifies the number of bytes to read from the target I2C
    slave device. This size must not exceed the size of the buffer pointed to by
    the read_buffer parameter.
 
  @param options:
    The options parameter is used to indicate if the I2C bus should be released
    on completion of the write-read transaction. Using the I2C_RELEASE_BUS
    constant for the options parameter causes a STOP bit to be generated at the
    end of the write-read transaction causing the bus to be released for other
    I2C devices to use. Using the I2C_HOLD_BUS constant as options parameter
    prevents a STOP bit from being generated at the end of the write-read
    transaction, preventing other I2C devices from initiating a bus transaction.

    milliseconds. I2C_wait_complete() will return I2C_TIMED_OUT if the current
    transaction has not completed after the time out delay has expired. This
    parameter can be set to I2C_NO_TIMEOUT to indicate that I2C_wait_complete()
    must not time out.

  Time out delay expiration.

  This function is used to control the expiration of the time out delay
  specified as a parameter to the I2C_wait_complete() function. It must be
  called from the interrupt service routine of a periodic interrupt source such
  as the Cortex-M3 SysTick timer interrupt. It takes the period of the interrupt
  source as its ms_since_last_tick parameter and uses it as the time base for
  the I2C_wait_complete() function’s time out delay.
  
  Note: This function does not need to be called if the I2C_wait_complete()
        function is called with a timeout_ms value of I2C_NO_TIMEOUT.
  Note: If this function is not called then the I2C_wait_complete() function
        will behave as if its timeout_ms was specified as I2C_NO_TIMEOUT and it
        will not time out.
  Note: If this function is being called from an interrupt handler (e.g SysTick)
        it is important that the calling interrupt have a lower priority than
        the CoreI2C interrupt(s) to ensure any updates to shared data are

    The ms_since_last_tick parameter specifies the number of milliseconds that

    typically be a constant specifying the interrupt rate of a timer used to
    generate system ticks.

    Note:   This buffer size indirectly specifies the maximum I2C write
            transaction length this CoreI2C channel can be the target of. This
            is because this CoreI2C channel responds to further received

  This function is used as part of the configuration of a CoreI2C channel for

    by the CoreI2C slave as a memory offset value during the write phase of
    write-read transactions. The maximum value for the offset_length parameter
    is two. The value of offset_length has the following effect on the 
    interpretation of the received data.
    
      If offset_length is 0, the offset into the transmit buffer is fixed at 0.
      
      If offset_length is 1, a single byte of received data is interpreted as an
      unsigned 8 bit offset value in the range 0 to 255.
      
      If offset_length is 2, 2 bytes of received data are interpreted as an
      unsigned 16 bit offset value in the range 0 to 65535. The first byte
      received in this case provides the high order bits of the offset and
      the second byte provides the low order bits.

  The I2C_set_user_data() function is used to allow the association of a block
  of application specific data with a CoreI2C channel. The composition of the 
  data block is an application matter and the driver simply provides the means
  for the application to set and retrieve the pointer. This may for example be
  used to provide additional channel specific information to the slave write 
  handler.

    channel 0 of the instantiated CoreI2C hardware.

    The p_user_data parameter is a pointer to the user specific data block for
