/**
 * \defgroup gpio_group General Purpose Input/Output
 *
 * This is the common API for GPIO. Additional features are available
 * in the documentation of the specific modules.
 *
 * \section io_group_platform Platform Dependencies
 *
 * The following functions are available on all platforms, but there may
 * be variations in the function signature (i.e. parameters) and
 * behaviour. These functions are typically called by platform-specific
 * parts of drivers, and applications that aren't intended to be
 * portable:
 *   - gpio_pin_is_low()
 *   - gpio_pin_is_high()
 *   - gpio_set_pin_high()
 *   - gpio_set_pin_group_high()
 *   - gpio_set_pin_low()
 *   - gpio_set_pin_group_low()
 *   - gpio_toggle_pin()
 *   - gpio_toggle_pin_group()
 *   - gpio_configure_pin()
 *   - gpio_configure_group()
