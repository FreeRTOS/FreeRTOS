 * This file contains the interrupt processing for the driver for the Xilinx
 * Interrupt Controller.  The interrupt processing is partitioned separately such
 * that users are not required to use the provided interrupt processing.  This
 * file requires other files of the driver to be linked in also.
 *
 * The interrupt handler, XScuGic_InterruptHandler, uses an input argument which
 * is an instance pointer to an interrupt controller driver such that multiple
 * interrupt controllers can be supported.  This handler requires the calling
 * function to pass it the appropriate argument, so another level of indirection
 * may be required.
 *
 * The interrupt processing may be used by connecting the interrupt handler to
 * the interrupt system.  The handler does not save and restore the processor
 * context but only handles the processing of the Interrupt Controller. The user
 * is encouraged to supply their own interrupt handler when performance tuning is
 * deemed necessary.
 *
 * <pre>
 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- ---------------------------------------------------------
 * 1.00a drg  01/19/10 First release
 * 1.01a sdm  11/09/11 XScuGic_InterruptHandler has changed correspondingly
 *		      since the HandlerTable has now moved to XScuGic_Config.
 * 3.00  kvn  02/13/15 Modified code for MISRA-C:2012 compliance.
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * This driver assumes that the context of the processor has been saved prior to
 * the calling of the Interrupt Controller interrupt handler and then restored
 * after the handler returns. This requires either the running RTOS to save the
 * state of the machine or that a wrapper be used as the destination of the
 * interrupt vector to save the state of the processor and restore the state
 * after the interrupt handler returns.
