/*
 * This file is part of the demo project that shows use of the coreSNTP library to create
 * an SNTP client (daemon) task for synchronizing system time with internet time and
 * maintaining Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) (or wall-clock time) in the system.
 *
 * This file contains the SNTP client (daemon) task as well as functionality for
 * maintaining wall-clock or UTC time in RAM. The SNTP client periodically synchronizes
 * system clock with SNTP/NTP server(s). Any other task running an application in the
 * system can query the system time. For an example of an application task querying time
 * from the system, refer to the SampleAppTask.c file in this project.
 *
 * This demo shows how the coreSNTP library can be used to communicate with SNTP/NTP
 * servers in a mutually authenticated through the use of symmetric-key based AES-128-CMAC
 * algorithm. To run this demo with an SNTP/NTP server in authenticated mode, the AES-128-CMAC
 * symmetric key needs to be pre-shared between the client (i.e. this demo) and the server.
 *
 * !!!Note!!!:
 * Even though this demo shows the use of AES-128-CMAC, a symmetric-key cryptographic based
 * solution, for authenticating SNTP communication between the demo (SNTP client) and
 * SNTP/NTP server, we instead RECOMMEND that production devices use the most secure authentication
 * mechanism alternative available with the Network Time Security (NTS) protocol, an asymmetric-key
 * cryptographic protocol. For more information, refer to the NTS specification here:
 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8915

/**
 * @brief The demo implementation of the @ref SntpSetTime_t interface
 * for correcting the system clock time based on the  time received
 * from the server response and the clock-offset value calculated by
 * the coreSNTP library.
 *
 * @note This demo uses a combination of "step" AND "slew" methodology
 * for system clock correction.
 * 1. "Step" correction is ALWAYS used to immediately correct the system clock
 *    to match server time on every successful time synchronization with a
 *    time server (that occurs periodically on the poll interval gaps).
 *
 * 2. "Slew" correction approach is used for compensating system clock drift
 *    during the poll interval period between time synchronization attempts with
 *    time server(s) when latest time server is not known. The "slew rate" is
 *    calculated ONLY once on the occasion of the second successful time
 *    synchronization with a time server. This is because the demo initializes
 *    system time with (the first second of) the democonfigSYSTEM_START_YEAR
 *    configuration, and thus, the the actual system clock drift over a period
 *    of time can be calculated only AFTER the demo system time has been synchronized
 *    with server time once. Thus, after the first time period of poll interval has
 *    transpired, the system clock drift is calculated correctly on the subsequent
 *    successful time synchronization with a time server.
 *
 * @note The above system clock correction algorithm is just one example of a correction
 * approach. It can be modified to suit your application needs. For example, your
 * application can use ONLY the "step" correction methodology for simplicity of system clock
 * time calculation logic if the application is not sensitive to abrupt time changes
 * (that occur at the instances of periodic time synchronization attempts). In such a case,
 * the Sntp_CalculatePollInterval() API of coreSNTP library can be used to calculate
 * the optimum time polling period for your application based on the factors of your
 * system's clock drift rate and the maximum clock drift tolerable by your application.
 *
 *
 * @param[in] pTimeServer The time server from whom the time has been received.
 * @param[in] pServerTime The most recent time of the server, @p pTimeServer, sent in its
 * time response.
 * @param[in] clockOffsetMs The value, in milliseconds, of system clock offset relative
 * to the server time calculated by the coreSNTP library. If the value is positive, then
 * the system is BEHIND the server time, and a "slew" clock correction approach is used in
 * this demo. If the value is negative, then the system time is AHEAD of the server time,
 * and a "step" clock correction approach is used in this demo.
 * @param[in] leapSecondInfo This indicates whether there is an upcoming leap second insertion
 * or deletion (according to astronomical time) the last minute of the end of the month that the
 * system time needs to adjust for. Leap second adjustment is valuable for applications that

/**
 * @brief The demo implementation of the @ref SntpValidateServerAuth_t function of the authentication
 * interface required by the coreSNTP library to execute validation of server as the source of the
 * received SNTP response by verifying the authentication information present in the packet.
 *
 * This function first checks whether the passed time server has authentication key information configured
 * in the demo to determine if the server supports authentication. If the time server supports authentication,
 * the function utilizes the corePKCS11 library to verify the AES-128-CMAC signature in the packet, @p pResponseData
 * that represents the server authentication code.
 *
 * @param[in] pAuthContext The authentication context representing the time server of use and its authentication
 * credentials.
 * @param[in] pTimeServer The current time server of use from which the response data, @p pResponseData has been
 * received by the SNTP client. This SHOULD match the time server information carried by the authentication context.
 * @param[in] pResponseData The buffer representing the SNTP response packet, received from the server, @p pTimeServer,
 * which contains the server authentication code, if the server supports authentication. The authentication code, if present,
 * is verified using corePKCS11 to be the expected AES-128-CMAC signature using the standard 48 bytes of SNTP packet data
 * present in the buffer and the secret symmetric key configured for the server.
 * @param[in] responseSize The total buffer size of the @p pResponseData for the SNTP response packet.
 *
 * @return Returns one of the following:
 * - SntpSuccess if EITHER no authentication key information has been configured for the time server, and thus,
 * no AES-CMAC validation operation is performed OR the time server supports authentication and the authentication
 * code has been successfully validated @p pBuffer.
 * - SntpErrorAuthFailure if there is internal failure in PKCS#11 operations in validating the server authentication code as
 * as the AES-128-CMAC for the information present in the response packet, @p pResponseData.
 * - SntpServerNotAuthenticated if the server is not validated from the response due to the authentication code not matching
 * the expected AES-128-CMAC signature.
