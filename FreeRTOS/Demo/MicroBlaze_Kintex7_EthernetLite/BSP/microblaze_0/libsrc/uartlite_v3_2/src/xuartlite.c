 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 * Ver   Who  Date     Changes
 * ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
 * 1.00a ecm  08/31/01 First release
 * 1.00b jhl  02/21/02 Repartitioned the driver for smaller files
 * 1.00b rmm  05/13/03 Fixed diab compiler warnings relating to asserts
 * 1.01a jvb  12/13/05 Changed Initialize() into CfgInitialize(), and made
 *                     CfgInitialize() take a pointer to a config structure
 *                     instead of a device id. Moved Initialize() into
 *                     xgpio_sinit.c, and had Initialize() call CfgInitialize()
 *                     after it retrieved the config structure using the device
 *                     id. Removed include of xparameters.h along with any
 *                     dependencies on xparameters.h and the _g.c config table.
 * 1.01a wsy  05/08/06 fix CR220811 and CR224103.
 * 1.12a mta  03/31/07 Updated to new coding conventions
 * 1.13a sv   01/21/08 Updated driver to support access through DCR bus
 * 1.14a sdm  09/26/08 Updated code to avoid race condition in
 *		      XUartLite_SendBuffer
 * 2.00a ktn  10/20/09 Updated to use HAL Processor APIs. The macros have been
 *		      renamed to remove _m from the name. XUartLite_mClearStats
 *		      macro is removed and XUartLite_ClearStats function should
 *		      be used in its place.
 * 2.00a hvm  08/11/11 Removed the SetOptions related information in the
 *			Recv and RecvBuffer function header notes section.
 *			CR620849.
 * 2.01a adk  18/04/13 Updated the code to avoid unused variable
 *			 warnings when compiling with the -Wextra -Wall flags
 *			 In the file xuartlite.c. CR:704999.
 * 3.1	nsk  21/07/15 Updated XUartLite_ReceiveBuffer function to update the
 *		      receive data into user buffer in critical region.
 *		      CR#865787.
 * 3.2   sk   11/10/15 Used UINTPTR instead of u32 for Baseaddress CR# 867425.
 *                     Changed the prototype of XUartLite_CfgInitialize API.
