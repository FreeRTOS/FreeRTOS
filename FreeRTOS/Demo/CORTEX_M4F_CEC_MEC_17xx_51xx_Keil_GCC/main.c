 * This is a simple example that creates two tasks and one queue.  One task
 * periodically sends a value to the other, which then prints out a message.
 * Normally such a simple example would toggle an LED, so the message that is
 * printed out is "toggle".
 *
 * The demo configures the kernel to be as simple as possible; FreeRTOSConfig.h
 * excludes most features, including dynamic memory allocation.
