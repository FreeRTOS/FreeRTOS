/* ****************************************************************************
 * When configCREATE_LOW_POWER_DEMO is set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h main() will
 * call main_low_power(), which is defined in this file.  main_low_power()
 * demonstrates FreeRTOS tick suppression being used to allow the MCU to be
 * placed into the Sleep, Low Power Sleep and Stop low power modes.  When
 * configCREATE_LOW_POWER_DEMO is set to 0 main will instead call main_full(),
 * which is a more comprehensive RTOS demonstration.
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 * This application demonstrates the FreeRTOS tickless idle mode (tick
 * suppression) being used to allow the STM32L to enter various low power modes
 * during extended idle periods.  See
 * http://www.freertos.org/low-power-tickless-rtos.html for information on
 * tickless operation.
 *
 * Deeper low power modes have longer wake up periods that lighter low power
 * modes, and power is also used simply entering and especially exiting the low
 * power modes.  How the low power modes are used therefore requires careful
 * consideration to ensure power consumption is truly minimised and that the
 * embedded device meets its real time requirements.  This demo is configured to
 * select between four different modes depending on the anticipated idle period.
 * Note the time thresholds used to decide which low power mode to enter are
 * purely for convenience of demonstration and are not intended to represent
 * optimal values for any particular application.
 *
 * The STM32L specific part of the tickless operation is implemented in
 * STM32L_low_power_tick_management.c.
 *
 * The demo is configured to execute on the STM32L Discovery board.
 *
 * Functionality:
 *
 *  + Two tasks are created, an Rx task and a Tx task.  A queue is created to
 *	  pass a message from the Tx task to the Rx task.
 *
 *  + The Rx task blocks on a queue to wait for data, blipping an LED each time
 *    data is received (turning it on and then off again) before returning to
 *    block on the queue once more.
 *
 *  + The Tx task repeatedly blocks on an attempt to obtain a semaphore, and
 *	  unblocks if either the semaphore is received or its block time expires.
 *	  After leaving the blocked state the Tx task uses the queue to send a
 *	  value to the Rx task, which in turn causes the Rx task to exit the
 *	  Blocked state and blip the LED.  The rate at which the LED is seen to blip
 *	  is therefore dependent on the block time.
 *
 *  + The Tx task's block time is changed by the interrupt service routine that
 *	  executes when the USER button is pressed.  The low power mode entered
 *	  depends on the block time (as described in the Observed Behaviour section
 *	  below).  Four block times are used: short, medium, long and infinite.
 *
 * Observed behaviour:
 *
 * 1) The block time used by the Tx task is initialised to its 'short' value,
 * so when the Tx task blocks on the semaphore it times-out quickly, resulting
 * in the LED toggling rapidly.  The timeout period is less than the value of
 * configEXPECTED_IDLE_TIME_BEFORE_SLEEP (set in FreeRTOSConfig.h), so the
 * initial state does not suppress the tick interrupt or enter a low power mode.
 *
 * 2) When the button is pressed the block time used by the Tx task is increased
 * to its 'medium' value.  The longer block time results in a slowing of the
 * rate at which the LED toggles.  The time the Tx task spends in the blocked
 * state is now greater than configEXPECTED_IDLE_TIME_BEFORE_SLEEP, so the tick
 * is suppressed.  The MCU is placed into the 'Sleep' low power state while the
 * tick is suppressed.
 *
 * 3) When the button is pressed again the block time used by the Tx task is
 * increased to its 'long' value, so the rate at which the LED is observed to
 * blip gets even slow.  When the 'long' block time is used the MCU is placed
 * into its 'Low Power Sleep' low power state.
 *
 * 4) The next time the button is pressed the block time used by the Tx task is
 * set to infinite, so the Tx task does not time out when it attempts to obtain
 * the semaphore, and therefore the LED stops blipping completely.  Both tasks
 * are now blocked indefinitely and the MCU is placed into its 'Stop' low power
 * state.
 *
 * 5) Pressing the button one final time results in the semaphore being 'given'
 * to unblock the Tx task, the CPU clocks being returned to their pre-stop
 * state, and the block time being reset to its 'short' time.  The system is
 * then back to its initial condition with the LED blipping rapidly.
